Can a dragon cut down a meeple on his start card? Or It cut down a meeple on the next card?
I’m assuming you mean “as a result of placing a meeple using a magic portal” (from the same rule set) since normally, it would not be possible to place a meeple on a tile with the Dragon since the Dragon gets placed onto Volcano tiles, on which you’re not allowed to place meeples anyway, and then moves across existing tiles, and meeples are normally only placed on new tiles.

So with that said, I’d say that no, according to the rules the Dragon won’t eat a meeple on its own tile, since it eats meeples on the tiles it moves to, not from. It’s also not allowed to backtrack, so placing a meeple on the tile with the Dragon goes some way to protecting it, for a while at least. I suppose this is arguable depending on your understanding of the word “visited”, since the Dragon “may not move to a tile that it has already visited this turn” - did it “visit” it’s starting tile, or not?

Tema 2: How many unfinished cities? What is final score?
Pregunta:
Dear ALL,
How many unfinished cities you can see? What is final score?

Respuesta 1:
Only considering the unfinished city with meeple in it: 2 unfinished cities. The one in north-west is black´s with 3 points the other one south-east is probably blue´s (the one meeple is standing a bit awkward, I guess it´s a normal meeple though), winnig the city with 13 point.

There are tiles in the game that can divide this city into two separate cities. You don´t know until somebody fills the gap.

3 cities (including the small one close to a monastery). The two parts in the middle have no connection so are considered separate cities. Thus blue gets VPs for south-eastern part, black gets VPs for north-western part. Single tile city part has no meeples so no VPs

You have played it mostly correctly. If that happens the tile that cannot be placed is removed from the game - then another one is drawn.

Curiously one of the first board games I got by myself is its "nephew" Dorfromantik, then I wanted a competitive game about placing tiles but the Duel edition didn't conviced me. I've seen Carcassonne was the pioneer on this kind of gameplay and up to 2 to 5 players so I didn't think twice to buy it.

Maybe too much text but it works pretty good for me and I loved the shape and colours of Meeples first time I saw it, so cute

It makes sense in very specific situations. Returning can mean the tile returns and is put back into the bag a few times, which would be pretty annoying. Removing the tile completely is an elegant and simple solution to that.

Please note with expansions you could have more problematic tiles on the way and could be drawing and putting back a few of them. Eg, a few “city center” tiles and some roads / monasteries could be left in the bag. If “city center” is unplayable this would be a small nightmare to play if you keep returning the tiles to the bag



Tema 4: Streets claimed by two different players when connected?

They will both receive full points.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks!

Respuesta 3:
Whoever has the majority claims the points, ties are friendly. Often that will mean that both have one follower on the street and both will receive full points. But it is possible to engineer it such that one player has two followers to the other player's single follower and then only the player with the majority gets anything.

(If you're wondering how a single player could have two followers on a single road if you're not allowed to place followers on roads that already have one: consider how it could happen that two players have followers on the same road. You can do the same by yourself to strengthen your claim)

Tobias is correct, but to clarify: whoever has the majority (OF MEEPLES on that road) claims the points Additional meeples on a road can happen purposefully or inadvertantly. Two seemingly distant roads, each with a meeple on it, may meander and end up being connected.

@northjack
(In one of the expansions...I forget which one...there is even a BIG meeple in your supply which counts as two)
It's Inns & Cathedrals. This Big meeple is count as two meeples, or we can say, this meeple has power 2. So for majority you need to count power of meeples.
And it is also Mayor from Abbeys & Mayor large expansions which power is count of shields in the city. So it can be also 0. In this case, city is occupied, but for scoring purposes it has no power, so player with Mayor meeple in the city with zero shields scores 0 points
And there are also expansion Sheep & Hills which is very interesting when counting majority But it's different story



Tema 5: If you draw a tile with a city must it continue an existing city?
Pregunta:

Respuesta 3:
David Williams
@chux vomitus


The 20th Anniversary rules seem to be unambiguous on this. Thoughts?
The rule really is: place your tile so that each side that would be adjacent to an already placed tile would “continue the landscape” - so grass must be adjacent to grass, castle to castle, road to road. The tile you place must be adjacent to at least one already placed tile.

Respuesta 4:
Amusingly, the 20th Anniversary ruleset starts with the words, "If you are already familiar with the rules of Carcassonne, you do not need to read these rules."

What would have been cause for a real celebration would have been an unambiguous rule set for this relatively simple game!

I dislike the 'by example' way of presenting the rules that doesn't exhaust the possible actions that could be taken.

Going back to question, it is unclear what is meant by "In this case", but the clause, "if you draw a tile with a city, the city illustration must continue an existing city" seems to mean what it means. How do you fit it into an existing understanding of how the game works, other than to assume that it is wrong? Perhaps no one should read these rules?

Respuesta 5:
That is really poor rule wording

Respuesta 6:
Yes, they kind-of fixed it in the revised rules by adding, " ...(if you don’t just continue the fields)."

Respuesta 7:
I agree with the explanations given above, it is just really hard to get to this from the wording and examples given in the 20th A. rules. Thank goodness for the internet!

Respuesta 8:
Yes - the wording in the rule book there is unambiguous. It’s also unambiguously incorrect.

Weird that a simple, popular game that has had decades for the rules explanations to be honed can still throw up stuff like this.



Tema 6: lie in fields or lie about lying
Pregunta:
Hello. Is the small bottom meadow on this tile considered a field where you can place a farmer?

If so, why isn't it mentioned in the rules, like how it's confirmed that the triangle on this tile is a field to avoid confusion?

Rules say about this one: "There are two separate cities on this tile. The city with the coat of arms ends after the bridge in the lower field. This is important for field scoring." Does this 'lower' word mean that the 'upper' tiny crescent-shaped lawn is also considered a field?

So, is all of this fields?

Respuesta 1:
Any green is a field where you can place a farmer if unclaimed

Respuesta 2:
Just to add, about the last doubt, that means the city above is conected by the bridge to de field below, so farmers there may score it.

Likely, that rules clarification was more concerned with distinguishing the three separate cities and just happened to mention the field.

Yes, the use of "lower field" in this description presupposes an unmentioned upper field. Again this rules clarification was primarily concerned with describing where the upper city ended as Ariel already mentioned.

Tema 7: Newbies question: Completed feature and no meeples?
Pregunta:
A group of us played for the first time. The rules cover what happens when one meeple is on a completed feature and when there are multiple meeples on a completed feature, but the rules don't say what happens if a feature is completed and there are no meeples on it. How do veteran players and tournaments etc. handle this?

Does the player who put down a tile that completes a feature get points even if there are no meeples on that feature? Or are meeples required on a completed feature to score points?

Thank you.

Respuesta 1:
Each completed feature is scored separately. If there are no meeples to claim a feature, no-one gets the points for that feature.

Also note the order of the turn: place tile, optionally add a meeple to the placed tile (if possible), score completed features and return meeples. (So, you can place a meeple on an unclaimed feature and get it back in the next step, but can't do the same if you don't have a meeple in reserve.)

In the base game, when a feature is completed that has no meeples on it, no points are scored.

Respuesta 3:
Meeples are a limited and semi renewable resource in Carcassonne. If you have none available you'll score no points for any features that you close. So a large part of the game is meeple management, knowing when to close a feature with one or more of your meeples on it to return them to your supply beyond just optimal tile placement. Then of course there is the farmer deployment aspect because you'll never be able to get those meeples back, though they stand to gain you a boatload (fieldload?) of points for adjacent closed cities if you can craftily outmaneuver your opponents. It's really a brilliant design. Enjoy!!

Just to clarify.

Order of play is:

Put down the tile
Place one of your meeple
Score finished structure

So you can score a feature that had no meeple prior to placing your tile, IF you have a free meeple.

If you have no free meeple to score it, then nobody get points.

You might do better by asking this in the Carcassonne: Expansion 4 – The Tower forums. The audience will be smaller but I'm guessing most people responding there will have played the expansion.

Respuesta 2:
Yes. Sometimes you want to protect your meeple in large city so you place meeple to tower which is or which can be in range of your meeple. Sometimes it an change final score.
But you have to be also aware, that your meeple on tower is still not protected to be catch by other tower

Respuesta 3:
+1 to what @Ancia Sa says, you may also recover your meeples that way. Additionally, to balance a bit this inquiry, I apply a homemade rule: at the end of the game, a guard on a tower gains 1 point per tower segmet it has.

It really doesn't matter and the rules don't specify the number.

  comes with a bag intended to contain all the tiles of the base game and that expansion, players draw tiles from the bag. The official Carcassonne web shop, https://cundco.de/, usually has bags of different sizes available.
  comes with a cardboard tower intended to contain all the tiles being used. If I remember correctly a single tower will hold around 200 tiles - a lot more than the base game plus 3 major expansions. I bought one independently of the expansion from the Carcassonne web shop.
I tend to use the tower storage if I'm playing with multiple expansions but usually just go with a number of stacks, maybe 5 or 6? These will be spread around the table so that all players have easy access.
Go with whatever feels comfortable for you.

One rule that isn't in the rule book but almost everybody uses since it flat out improves the game is that you draw your new tile immediately after you complete your turn. This way you can start considering your next play as others take their turns. Only reveal your tile, as described in the rulebook, when it is actually your turn again.

I remember reading in one version of the rules that the active player should show their tile to the rest of the players, who are then allowed to offer advice, etc. I don't see that in the version I just found online, so maybe it's been changed, or maybe I just wasn't diligent enough in reading it, because I only did a quick scan, but anyway... I quite like that because it increases table talk and makes things a little more interactive. But I wouldn't like this if the other players had fore-knowledge of the tile they wanted to place next, because then self-interest is mixed with hidden information. Obviously, there's self-interest in the advice anyway, but it's possible to assess that as the active player because everyone's got the same information.

All of which is to say... not everybody uses that approach, and it changes the game, or at least the player interaction, in a semi-significant way - I wouldn't agree that it "flat out improves" it. I'd be happy to play that way if someone suggested it, but wouldn't as a matter of course. Also, some people take this even further and play with a hand of three tiles, so... it varies.

One rule that isn't in the rule book but almost everybody uses since it flat out improves the game is that you draw your new tile immediately after you complete your turn. This way you can start considering your next play as others take their turns. Only reveal your tile, as described in the rulebook, when it is actually your turn again.
I remember reading in one version of the rules that the active player should show their tile to the rest of the players, who are then allowed to offer advice, etc. I don't see that in the version I just found online, so maybe it's been changed, or maybe I just wasn't diligent enough in reading it, because I only did a quick scan, but anyway... I quite like that because it increases table talk and makes things a little more interactive. But I wouldn't like this if the other players had fore-knowledge of the tile they wanted to place next, because then self-interest is mixed with hidden information. Obviously, there's self-interest in the advice anyway, but it's possible to assess that as the active player because everyone's got the same information.

All of which is to say... not everybody uses that approach, and it changes the game, or at least the player interaction, in a semi-significant way - I wouldn't agree that it "flat out improves" it. I'd be happy to play that way if someone suggested it, but wouldn't as a matter of course. Also, some people take this even further and play with a hand of three tiles, so... it varies.
What you mention reminds me of the "standard" house rule of drawing the next tile immediately after you play to speed-up the game.
I always played with this rule and there's still interaction, "honest" or more "sneaky", depending on the players, but in the end is always the active player that has to evaluate the input and (obviously) make the final decision.

That's a fair point. Whether that information about giving advice is still in the rules or not I sometimes play that way depending on the company. However I trust myself enough that if I've already agreed to play in such a manner I will give genuine advice and won't use the knowledge of my own next tile to undermine that. As a 'reasonable' Carcassonne player I've usually considered what's the worst that could happen when taking my own turn. If someone is seeking advice I'll say (even without seeing their tile), "One thing that would really hurt me right now would be X so if you have a tile that can do that, it'd be a great move."

Each player starts off with 2 stacks, and of course you can always ask another player to give you one of their tiles!

We have talked about looking at your next tile as soon as you finish your current turn, but we all like to “give advice” to the other players, knowing your next move doesn’t seem fair that way!

Tema 11: Can I score for the same completed city twice with 2 farmers?
Pregunta:
If a completed city has one of my farmers on one side and another farmer on another side, and those farmers don't share farms, do I score 3 or 6 points?

The rulebook I read didn't explicitly say that farms scored only once per player, but it seemed to imply so with examples. Does it work that way?

Respuesta 1:
The rules at least seem to me to say that you score for all completed castles on any given field regardless of other fields.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, absolutely. I think of it as this: You're scoring the farms once each, but farms are determined by the cities they border.

Respuesta 3:
You score each field/farm separately. A completed city can be "supplied" by multiple fields.

Which edition of the game (by which publisher) do you have? There have been a lot of Carcassonne rulebooks over the years; I don't see that example in any one that I own.

For reference, the 2012 Zman rulebook includes this line about farmers: "More than one field may touch and score the same city."

Respuesta 6:
The rules here says that «  All fields touched by a city will see their value increased by 3 points. »

Respuesta 7:
If you have two farmers in ONE field (can happen if they were separate and later joined up), then you only score one of the farmers.
If you have two farmers in SEPARATE fields then you score both farmers for all the cities they connect to. So they can score the same city multiple times.

The example in the picture is ambiguous. as it depends what is happening at the top and bottom of the city. If the two apparent fields are in fact contiguous then you will get three points. If the fields are separate then you will score six points. The former is more likely as you would need to effectively form a wall of cities to separate the fields.

Respuesta 11:
@Banoro
There's been (at least) three versions of farmer scoring in the past 20 years.
Going by the rules I'm used to, and experienced at BoardGameArena, if the picture shown was the extent of the board then blue would score 3 points for each field area as they do not connect. (The top right of the third tile would score nothing for having no Meeple and no complete city.)
(I believe one of the earlier scoring methods was By City, not By Field and that system would lead to 3 points total for blue in the given picture.

Respuesta 12:
Let me give a visual example of what we are talking about:



Before Red plays the tile in the lower right corner, there are two separate farms, each with a Blue farmer. Each of Blue's farmers will score 3 points for the city, a total of 6 points for that city! Once Red plays the connecting tile for the farm, there is now only one farm that is touching the city. It does not matter that Blue has two meeple on the same farm, he only owns one farm, so he only scores 3 points one time for his one farm.

Depend of your edition and publisher of Carcassonne.

Quote:
The 1st edition rules were scored from the perspective of the cities themselves: that is, you picked a city, and counted the number of farmers on all the farms touching that city. The player with the majority of those farmers scored 4 points. Then play moved on to the next city.

2nd edition rules followed almost immediately — after Carcassonne won Game of the Year (GotY), in fact. The original 1st edition farmer rules were considered to be too difficult by the jury and they were changed; although this led to calls for Carcassonne to be stripped of the award, since the game that won was not actually the game subsequently sold as the GotY.

The 2nd edition rules changed to scoring farms from the perspective of the farms — pick a farm, count the farmers on it, and the player with the most farmers scores 3 points for every city touching the farm. But like 1st edition rules, each city could only be scored once, meaning you still had to keep track of which cities had scored 3 points and which not.

3rd edition rules came swiftly and removed that qualification, so that each city could now be scored multiple times. The great virtue of the 3rd edition rules is that you don't have to keep track of which cities have been scored, only which farms — and since you should remove the farmers after a given farm has been scored, it isn't overly difficult to do so. Also, in the 1st edition rules, the farms weren't actually scored directly, but only indirectly, making the notion of 'farmer' scoring slightly misleading and difficult to grasp for younger players (this, essentially, was the jury's objection).

Quote:
While 3rd edition rules have been used in Germany since 2002, RGG initially chose to stick with the 1st edition rules. The usual arguments for this decision revolved around consistency (it would confuse people to change the rules) and authenticity (1st edition rules are the ones that won GotY, after all).

If the completed feature has no meeple on it, then to score it one must place a meeple on it that turn, even though the meeple immediately comes off. In that case, one cannot score and place a meeple on a different feature on the same turn because that would be placing two meeples on a single turn. If the completed feature already before the turn had on it a meeple for which to score the completed feature, then one can place a meeple on the placed tile of the turn but on a different feature. In the latter case, one is only placing a single meeple on the turn.
EDIT:
As someone points out above, to place a meeple on a turn, one must have an available meeple at the start of the turn before any meeples are removed.

Respuesta 4:
See above. The order matters.

Tema 15: River source tile counts as 2 tiles

It seems they are counted as 2 tiles for all purposes from what you've said so ...

Respuesta 2:
That’s what we went with, but it is confusing since the city is clearly on one half of the tile. There were other confusing things that came up such as whether a bordering monastery got to count the source tile as two tiles even though only one half of it was in one of the eight surrounding positions. I wish the rules were a bit clearer on this. I think this is a case where the brevity of the rules language hurts clarity (or at least forces you into a situation where applying it literally seems to defy common sense interpretations).

Respuesta 3:
OK, so I don't claim to be the source of a definitive answer but having looked closely at the rules document my feeling is that the statement;
Quote:
During the game, the “source” tile counts as 2 tiles for all purposes
could be interpreted to mean;
Quote:
During the game, the “source” tile should be treated as if it were 2 tiles for all purposes
So, in the city situation you describe only one of the "2 tiles" counts towards the score. Likewise for the road.
With regards to monasteries; Where a monastery is orthogonally adjacent to one of the long sides then both the "2 tiles" count towards that monastery's scoring. However if a monastery is orthogonally adjacent to one of the short sides or diagonally adjacent to any part of the Source tile then only one of the "2 tiles" count towards that monastery's scoring.

This seems the common sense approach and, I think, would need to be contradicted by a ruling from the publisher. I'll ask around among my Carcassonne friends for potentially better informed insight.



Tema 16: 2-tiles cities and roads are legal?
Pregunta:
There's a very cheap trick that I've done (and seen done) but I don't know if the rules would allow that.
I think they do but it's so bad I usually restrain anywyas:
Imagine you already have on the table a tile with one city edge. Nobody has their meeples there.
Then you draw another tile with a city edge. You place it in front of the other tile, effectively closing the city - at the same time you place your meeple there, and immediately you score 4 points (2-tile city) and take your meeple back (because the city is complete).
You can do the same with a road tile: you get a 'crossroads' tile, you place it in front of another crossorad and voila, you score 2 points "for free".

TL;DR: can you place your meeple right on the tile that finishes a city/road and immediately score and keep your meeple too?

Respuesta 1:
Yes. But you need to have one meeple to place.

1. Place a tile
2. Optionally place a meeple on the tile just placed (or any of the extension meeples)
3. Score all completed features. (And return meeples.)

(Previous rulesets gave just 2 points per 2-tile city, but 4 points per completed city for farmers. Check the scoring of your ruleset from the rules.)

Respuesta 2:
Indeed. We do this in every game.
These 2-tile cities also come in handy to boost the scoring for a field you are dominating.
There's nothing bad or wrong about these 2-tile structures. It is yet another way to score more points.
In the early 2000's the scoring for these cities was different, but I have owned the game since 2008 and mine already had the newer scoring. 4 points for a 2-tile city (2 points for each tile), and 3 points for a city in a field. (if you don't take into account the pigs).

It´s a totally normal play in Carcassonne. No need to restrain.

In an earlier rules set you gained only 2 points fpr this play instead of 4. At some point they changed that because why not doing it. But if you feel this kind of play should be punished you could still house rule it to the older rules version.

Respuesta 4:
You not only can complete 2 tile cities and roads, but I also don't see it as even close to being a "cheap trick".
If there's a city edge tile not claimed is because another player (or even you) played it in a previous turn and didn't want, or couldn't place a meeple there, maybe because they run out of meeples or because they place a meeple in another section of the tile.
Whatever the case might be, the city is open for grabs and anyone is free to finish and claim it with another city edge tile and collect the points accordingly.

As Pasi mentioned, you are not scoring for free, because you need to have an available meeple to score.

Taking your view to the extreme, let's consider for a moment that, for some reason, there's an unclaimed 5 tile city (situation 1), or an unclaimed 5 tile road (situation 2) on the board.
Situation 1 - if you draw a city edge tile and have an available meeple, wouldn't you be able to place the tile and a meeple, finishing the city, collecting the respective points (10 points if no shields) and recovering immediately your meeple?
Situation 2- if you draw a road intersection or road end tile, and have an available meeple, wouldn't you be able to place the tile and a meeple, finishing the road, collect the respective points (5 points) and recovering immediately your meeple?

Following your argument, you would be scoring these points "for free" and even "trickier", you would be scoring more points than a mere 2 tile city/road!

TLDR: yes, you can place a meeple right on the tile that finishes a city/road and immediately score and recover your meeple.

Respuesta 7:
Tactically, yes you're getting a quick two or four points. Strategically, you're increasing the value of that farm for somebody, or restricting the boundaries of a farm with complicated roads. The strategic significance often outweighs the tactical on this. Either way, of course it's absolutely legal. Wouldn't the rules say if it weren't?

I agree that getting four points for a two-tile city is so easy as to be boring - in that it's probably the right move when available - so I recommend the rule from earlier editions that two-tile cities do not double in value.

Respuesta 10:
We play with the old rules of a 2 tile city only score 2 points because when they score 4 points, with good players, it is all you try to do because there is no purpose to try to build bigger cities with these tiles. Even with 2 points only it is a strong strategy.

Respuesta 11:
Despite this being the official rule, I agree that this feels like a cheap trick. In fact, it tends to confuse new players, who say something like, "Huh, you can really do that?"

That would mean that, let's say, there's a 7 tile not claimed road and you draw any tile that could close it, you cannot score the road even if you close it?

Respuesta 13:
Hypothetically, an unclaimed 7-tile road could exist, but I think the chance of that is very small. Anyway, I would still apply my rule to that situation.

The principle implied by the rule is that:
(1) The road or city is considered complete as soon as you lay down a tile that completes it.
(2) You can't place a meeple on the road or city after it is complete.

I don't see how maturity enters into it at all, but if it does, I would think the more mature choice would be to play by the current rules rather than changing them because it "feels" bad.

Respuesta 15:
I understand where these rules come from but, as long as the playfield and the scoring possibilities are the same for all players, I don't see the need for this type of changes.
If it is true that, in a certain game, a player can score a few points more than the others if he has the opportunity to close a few 2 tile cities, chances are this will level out in the long run.
And it is not like the other players cannot do anything about it.
What if you, as the "other player", place a tile in a position where it makes harder or even impossible to close that 2 tile city?
What if you place a city tile (and meeple) in a position where the other player would likely have to connect the original city tile to yours, forming a larger city and sharing points?

Respuesta 16:
I respect the points made in defense of the official rules. I play by those rules as well. However, I think the rule allowing scoring of a road or city with a "bounce" meeple (as some call it) is a weakness of the game.

I'd like to know why the designer chose to incorporate the bounce meeple rule. Perhaps he had a good reason. Maybe he did it just to give players something to accomplish when they couldn't do anything better.

Anyway, here are my reasons for changing the rule:

Intuitiveness: My rule (and it's not really my rule) is more intuitive. You don't even need to mention it when teaching the game. The official rule allowing the bounce meeple is a special rule that has to be explained to new players.

Aesthetics and theme: Do you like a game map crowded with little "football" cities? Do you like to see short 2-segment roads laid out in a grid pattern on an outlying part of the map, like some abandoned Florida real estate development? The official rule encourages such results.

Game play: Must we allow players to mindlessly grab as many cheap points as they can, or can we force them to think a little harder?

Scoring: I hate to see new players, who worked hard to accumulate points during the game, become discouraged at the end because they were easily surpassed by an experienced player, who created a bunch of football cities next to his farm. My rule would help to even the playing field for inexperienced players.

Things get open enough that you often have stray "football halves" out there that you can just close with the other half, and a meeple, so it seems there's only so much that can be done in that regard.

I thought farms help combat this? One player is getting 4pts per city, while the farmer gets 3pts. However, the latter player is also free to use their turns scoring other features like Roads, larger Cities, and Cloisters.

Personally I think it is more intuitive to allow a player to place a meeple if he's able to (following the rules), than restricting when they can place it, even if that means a "bounce meeple".
And don't you have to mention "your" rule while teaching? New players would likely be as surprised if, during the game, you told them their not allowed to place a meeple in certain situations.

@Brad_Jones
Aesthetics and theme: Do you like a game map crowded with little "football" cities? Do you like to see short 2-segment roads laid out in a grid pattern on an outlying part of the map, like some abandoned Florida real estate development? The official rule encourages such results.
For cities, I see what you mean, although I have no issues with the visual outcome. And it is not as if you wouldn't have 2 tile cities altogether, because a player can (and probably will if they can) place a meeple in a newly placed tile with 1 city border, being able to close it in a future turn with another tile with 1 city border.
Talking about roads, the limitation of this rule makes no sense to me as, whenever I draw a tile that ends a road, I look for the best scoring possibility to close an unclaimed road. And this is rarely a 2 tile road.

Brad Jones
@Brad_Jones
Game play: Must we allow players to mindlessly grab as many cheap points as they can, or can we force them to think a little harder?
Here I see it as a balance between 2 tile cities and farms. Having many 2 tile cities does not mean you don't have to think about what you're doing, because you might be "giving away points" to other player that is dominating the farms.

Brad Jones
@Brad_Jones
Scoring: I hate to see new players, who worked hard to accumulate points during the game, become discouraged at the end because they were easily surpassed by an experienced player, who created a bunch of football cities next to his farm. My rule would help to even the playing field for inexperienced players.
Wouldn't this be part of the learning curve? I would personally explain clearly the farm scoring to these new players, not only in the beginning, but also during the first few games and even later if I see that a less experienced player is missing out on some scoring opportunities.

This is probably very personal and might not be your experience, but I don't see (and play) Carcassonne as a real competitive game where I must fight for every point.
To me, this normally comes to the table in moments where we want to play something more relaxed and the overall game progress reflects that.

They are not "cheap points". You need to have a meeple to claim them. So, your variant rather "traps" a player's meeple for a round in the cases they don't have better scoring opportunities than completing an already existing feature.

And what if there's a 2-tile city you're adding a tile and meeple to to complete it? Are you then not "deserving" the points?

You're not really making the game harder for the experienced player with this rule change. The experienced player can work around the limitation, but the inexperienced player could not. Play without farmers if you want to make the game easier for the inexperienced player for their first few plays.

@Brad_Jones
Despite this being the official rule, I agree that this feels like a cheap trick. In fact, it tends to confuse new players, who say something like, "Huh, you can really do that?"

Instead, I propose this replacement rule, which has probably been mentioned before:

To score points for a road or city, a meeple must be on the road or city already before a player lays down the tile that completes it.

I think this is the more mature way to play the game.
I like this!

Respuesta 21:
After some more thought, I realize my modification would alter the game in a fundamental way. The basic sequence of play is: (1) place tile, (2) place meeple, and (3) score. My change would reverse (2) and (3). A player would place a tile, score, and then put a meeple on the tile just placed, except not on a feature that had just been completed. So, that is a significant change.

I know some people play this way, and I think it's worth trying out. However, most of us will be satisfied with letting the game be what it is. It may seem shallow at times, but it's still fun.

Correct. The advantage of the Abbot is that you can take it back on a turn on which you don’t place a meeple, and in doing so, partially score its incomplete feature. Added to which, only the Abbot can treat Gardens as Monasteries, so it gives greater access to this sort of scoring.

It's not even a matter of interpretation. Step 3, scoring, explicitly says that only Abbots can be on gardens. The same is found in Spanish and in any other translation for sure. Abbots have 2 abilities: 1st, they can be placed on gardens, 2nd, they may score their incomplete monasteries/gardens during the game. There is no point of taking out the 1st one from them, that will unbalance them.

The punchboards are not perfectly aligned, so even if the corner of the city graphics doesn't extend all the way to the corner of the tile, the city is still considered to be doing so. So, neither the fields or cities can wiggle through using this production variance.

I disagree. About tiles borders, what it matters is their sides, never their corners, and this is out of discussion. Misprints are misprints, and can't ever be treated as if they override this. What a meeple does inside their tile and tile's inside art is other topic, that neither override my friendly advice. Not for nothing tiles are side coded (FRCR for example). Teaching Carcassonne countless of times, people look corners too much, even thinking they can't make certain moves because of them. Corners don't matter.

It is possible through clever placement of land tiles for there to be

completed road or city, the player with the most thieves (on a road)
or the most knights (in a city) earns all the points.

Respuesta 6:
According to page 5 of the Carcassonne rules in the new blue box set I just got from Amazon, as well as Z-man games' online rules pdf, a road section CANNOT have more than one player's meeple on it. Since each player starts out on their own road with their meeple, a player CANNOT place a tile that connects those two roads, but must play it elsewhere. So it can never occur that two differing meeples end up on the same road.

Respuesta 7:
That is true, except two roads can be joined together, thus having 2 meeples on it.

Respuesta 8:
Well, my printed rules say you can't:

but when I looked again at the referred-to online rules, it specifically says they can be. Very much opposed to each other.

My printed rules are dated 2021, while the online pdf rules are dated 2016. Seems we have a quandrey, assuming I interpret the rule above correctly.

Respuesta 9:
Actually, in reading it again, it says two things:
1) You are not able to place a meeple on that proposed new road section, since it already has one. One might assume, then, that you could place the tile, but NOT place a meeple, thus giving points to both. But..
2) Instead, you place the tile such that it continues the landscape, but does not connect to that road. I guess it doesn't say you HAVE to do that, though, just that the player decides to to it?

Respuesta 10:
You're missing something in the process.

Player A places a road tile, and places a meeple.
Player B places a disconnected road tile and also places a meeple.
Player A then places a road tile that connects the first two. There are now two legally placed meeples on the same road. This is a tried and true strategy within the game to steal points from other players.

Respuesta 11:

But there’s a difference between a road and a road section. Two meeples cannot be on the same section (in the base game rules), but they can end up on the same road through connecting tiles, just as they can end up on the same city.

Respuesta 13:
I think it is entirely possible for a player to end up with multiple meeples on the same road/farm/city, etc. Let's say you play a tile and put a meeple on the road. On a future turn, you place a tile somewhere else which has a road that does not connect to that other road...it may even be several tiles away. Later in the game, due to tile placements, those two unconnected roads become connected: You now have two of your meeples on that road, in addition to any others that may also be on that long and winding and previously unconnected road. (Same with open-ended cities or farms which eventually connect up, creating unified, completed features.)

Thanks all for the clarification.



Tema 20: meeples on the road
Pregunta:
Could it be multiple meeples of the same color in the same road? Also who have the most meeples (on the road) claim the point, right?

Respuesta 1:
Yes, any number of meeples of the same or different colours may end up on a single road. However, just like with cities and pastures, a meeple cannot be placed on an occupied road; instead, multiple separate occupied roads may be joined and in that way multiple meeples of any colour can end up in one project.

When it's finished, the majority scores the points.

There can be multiple colours who have the most meeples, in which case both colours score the full points.

Respuesta 2:
Very helpful. Thank you!

Respuesta 3:
It is very much possible that there are several meeples on the same road. They can be of different colour or of same colour. Just remeber to follow the normal limitations when placing new meeples. The colour who has the most meeple points on the road gets all the points. In case of a tie all players get all the points.

Respuesta 4:
It appears there are two sets of rules concerning different color meeples on the same road. The printed rules on the basic set I just got today from Amazon state that you cannot connect two roads with a tile if a different color meeple is on each:

whereas the Z-Man Game Rules PDF states just the opposite under the same rules section, and using the same map graphic as an example: in that example, both meeples get the points and are removed.

Am I misinterpreting the printed rules I have? The printed rules I have are dated 2021, while the online rules are dated 2016.

Respuesta 5:
Yes, you are misinterpreting. You can place the tile connecting roads with previous meeples on them. What you can't do is to place a meeple on the new tile if connects to those older meeples. In that example, the text talks about red player not placing the tile there, because of that, choosing instead other (not pictured) place where they could play a meeple on the new tile's road. EDIT: But the old text in the old rulebook was better. Maybe they decided to focus on that different player option, or they messed up the translations. But in no case they are saying a player can't place the C road there. EDIT 2: Aha! This new version text says "could continue", versus the old that says "decided to continue". No doubt, this time, they used the same picture to plot a more advanced player decision example.

Tema 21: What happens if you draw a tile that does not fit anywhere?
Pregunta:
What do we do if we draw a tile that doesn't match any of the available spaces? Does this happen often?
The most probable situation is if you draw an "inner city" tile and all the cities are closed.
This can also happen with a road tile, if all the roads are closed, or far less likely, when a a random tile with a road, farm and city does not fit the layout on the board.

You don't need this change. "Return the tile to the box" really means "remove the tile from the game". You draw from the draw stacks not the box. Return to the box also removes the chance that you repeatedly draw a tile that will never become playable.

I was thinking that if you use a drawstring bag to draw tiles, you could return it there so it could come out later in the game.

I think the reason they tell you to put it back in the box is just so you don’t get the same unplaceable tile drawn repeatedly, causing frustration.

Of course you’re right that it might become placeable later, but then again it might not, especially if you’re near the end of the game with very few tiles left. They may have thought it was just easier to remove the tile altogether and avoid the possibility.

The most common way this would happen - and the only way that I recall observing - is that early in a game, you draw the four sided city tile, but all the cities have been closed, or the open city edges are in such a way that it cannot be placed (e.g., a city edge with a grass edge diagonal to it).

Second most common way would probably be the four sided road edge with no incomplete roads, which could have a similar type of issue.

Almost every other piece will almost always fit SOMEWHERE, just maybe not where you want it!

Respuesta 14:
Well, this is obviously a rare occurrence, but I just wasn't sure about the official rule.

One way to house rule that I occasionally enjoy, while mostly avoiding even the slight chance of this happening, is to have a hand of 2 tiles.
In your turn, play one of the 2 tiles and draw 1 before moving to the next player. The main advantage is to minimize the small frustration of drawing a tile that does nothing for you at that moment, so you don't feel like you just wasted a turn, while allowing for some strategic planning ahead.

i believe to just keep it simple and not make an exception. I don't recall the timing but this might have been switched as a result of it getting the SdJ or so that it could be eligible for the SdJ.

Respuesta 3:
The original rules also gave 4pt per city to farmers, which encouraged small cities. When it was changed to 3 points per complete city for farmers, it wasn't necessary to reduce the points from two-tile cities anymore.

But then again, we played with mixed rulesets, so the above might not be totally accurate.

Tema 24: Am I allowed to place new meeples on shared features?
Pregunta:
I have a question about shared features in the game. I know that sometimes two cities, road's or fields claimed by different teams can be joined, which causes them to either be shared or overruled by one of the teams. Now I'm wondering, are both teams after this allowed to add tiles with meeples to this feature? Or can both teams only add new meeples to this feature by connecting other existing and claimed features as happened the first time?

Respuesta 1:
You're not adding "tiles with meeples". The order is:
1. Place a tile.
2. Optionally place a meeple to an unclaimed feature on the just-placed tile.
3. Score all completed features and all meeples on those are returned to their players.

You cannot place a meeple to a claimed feature. Not even on your own features.

You can only place a meeple to an unclaimed feature. You can place a tile to connect features, whether they are claimed or not.

(Edit: Yeah, like Sandy says, there are special meeples with their own rules that can override the general placement rule.)

Respuesta 2:
Ahh that clarifies a lot, thanks!

Respuesta 3:
In general, Pasi 'a1bert' Ojala is correct. With normal tile placement, you are not allowed to place another meeple on any feature that is already occupied.

But there are a few Expansions that do allow you to, for example, add your builder to a feature that you already own. And there are also expansions, like the Flying Machines or the 20th Anniversary tiles, that are specifically designed to allow you to place a meeple on already occupied features.

Respuesta 4:
Short supporting quote from contemporary Z-Man rules (2016) 

Quote:
2. Placing a meeple
* You may place a meeple on the tile you’ve just placed.
* You may not place a meeple in a feature where there already is at least one other meeple.

If they have any meeples in their supply, this is what seems to happen, but the actual order is the reverse.

Two or more features can be completed by placing a tile. You score all of the features at the end of the turn, even one where you just placed a meeple. But you can only do that if you have one in the supply.



Tema 25: Definition of a completed city

I'm a new player. In the Supplemental Rulesheet, the explanation under the large Farm diagram states that "City D" is not completed. I don't understand why is it not completed.
City D isn't completed because its wall doesn't fully surround the city. Take a look at the edge just below the letter "D": There's no wall there. Somebody would need to place another tile just below the D that finishes the city's wall to close it off.

(If the rules allowed completed cities to have edges like the one in city D, then every city, no matter how big or how it was arranged, would always be "complete" and there would be no reason to compete for points.)

Edit: From the Z-Man Carcassonne rulebook, p. 4: "A city is completed when it is surrounded by walls and there are no gaps inside the city."

City tiles can only ever be "incomplete" on the edges of tiles. Any part of the city that appears within the tile itself has a wall. So you only need to focus on the edges of tiles to see if a city is complete or not.

For example, take another look at the Supplemental Rules. In the green box at the very top of page 1, there's a tile with a small city segment. It is surrounded by a wall except on the top side. Or, look at City D again. The tile with a "D" on it has a city segment with a wall along the top area, and 3 open sides. Two of those open sides are matched up with other city segments (on the left and right) while the 3rd side, on the bottom, is not matched with anything -- which is why the city is incomplete.

The tile to the left of the D has a wall running diagonally from top left to bottom right, with open sides on the top and right. Each of them is matched with other city segments on other tiles.

Tema 26: How to score 2 tile city?
Pregunta:

The small city scoring was a feature in the first editions of the game. The rules were indeed that a small city, comprising of 2 small city parts, would score 2 points and not 4.
This carried over in the 2nd edition of the game, but as per 2002 (3rd edition of the rules), it was removed, and since then, small cities of 2 tiles score 4 points.
So if a rulebook has the small city scoring in it, it is an older edition. It is never really used anywhere anymore, but sometimes used as variant or house rule.

It would have to be your decision, I guess that all the latest versions of the game tell you that the scoring is 4 for a two tiles city.
My memory is hazy, but if I remember well 4 points for a two tiles city was in the very first version of the game, later someone came up with the idea that it was all too easy and the scoring should be only two (which I agree with and I play it that way).
I also find that a two points two tiles city gives more interest to the Castles from the Bridges, Castles & Bazaars expansion.

Respuesta 10:
It can of course differ a bit depending on which language/publisher you have the game from. When the game was first released (in Oct 2000), it was released in German, Dutch and English. Those languages all had the 2-point rule for small cities. It was to try and discourage the forming of such small cities and making big farms.
With several changes in the rules as well as the scoretrack and boxes, it is difficult to say exactly what the crossover point was. But, going on the German release (the original language of the game and where other publishers base their translated rules on), the change to 4 points for such cities came with the German 4th edition, in 2002

Even better, as the farmer scoring actually was changed based on recommendations from the SdJ jury.
The original farmer scoring had players check per city who had the most farmers, and score that way, rather than checking the cities in a farm.
As these rules were changed for the 3rd edition (2001), and then to the current rules for the 4ty edition (2002, together with the small city scoring), some people would indeed argue the game has changed too much to still be the same game that won the SdJ.

The SdJ discussion reminds me of the ancient philosophical thought experiment that if you build a ship, and over the course of many years you replace/repair/maintain its parts (sails, ropes, paint, hull, etc.) up to the point that every single original part has been removed: is it then still the same ship? E.g. the colour might have changed. A better kind of rope might be used. And so on.

Likewise: Carcassonne had changed almost 100% since the first edition: the design of the tile fronts, the box (design and possibly size), the rules in part, the colours of the meeples, the names of the meeples (at least in the Dutch edition, who didn't call them meeples until more recent editions), etc. Is it still the same game?

I am pretty sure that 'Spiel des Jahres' doesn't have those prerequisites and that it is just something they have dreamed up to justify their "holier-than-thou" attitude/superiority complex.

Eeek, wait, how can it be that it isn't really used anywhere? I own the very first edition of the game and that is what is stated in the game rules. So this is how we ever played this game forever. I never bothered to buy a new edition, and see no point in it, because I got a set of expansions and won't waste money for just new graphics. Plus I'm more interested in new games, rather than new copies of older games. So I learned about the rules change just recently , reading some comments here. And I see no point in changing the way we played this game just because rule books in other editions have some rules changed. If I will ever play with someone insisting on playing with "new" rules, I can adapt for that session, as now I'm aware of some "new rules" existing. But hey! Why on Earth should I play different way than the one stated in my rule book.
So yeah: to the topic. Yes, there are two different rules in different editions of the game and if you ever meet someone owning the old edition, they may know the rule of scoring small cities as 2. And they may still play it that way even in 2023

Definitely good reasoning, and of course why would you? If you are used to these rules, of course play it like that.
People who are new to the game will learn the rules without the small city scoring rule, and they will play it like that of course.

In the (inter)national tournaments for Carcassonne however, the game is played as per the current rules. 3 points per city in a farm, and no small city scoring. I remember it even being called out in the rules for the Dutch national championships. I guess they are aware some people might be used to the rules from older versions. Some publishers do things even further differently though, so the (inter)national championships are not always representative of the current rules for the game. But that is for a different discussion



Tema 27: When is a field not a field?
Pregunta:
A question arose tonight as my wife and I enjoyed another round of one of our favourite games.

Essentially, in the image below, is this a break in a field or a continuation?



There are some very explicit tiles that don't demonstrate this slight ambiguity (walls pressed against one another), and it's not something we've ever noticed before in the many times we've played. Given the cities go mostly to the edge, this suggests to me a break, two cities meeting. But my wife's argument is also sound as there is clearly green at the edge of the tiles suggesting either a continued field, or a slightly off printing of the image.

Any clarification greatly appreciated.

Respuesta 1:
It's a slightly offset cut, and the cities should go to the edge. Edges are (with a couple notable exceptions in expansions) only ever field or city, not both.

That should be a break in the field. The cities (should) come to the corner. The cut was offset unfortunately.

Respuesta 3:
The field will be separated into two fields there. The cities are assumed to extend to the very corner of the tile. A field cannot continue through the corner.

Respuesta 4:
Thank you all for your replies. Greatly appreciated

Respuesta 5:
The two cities block the field.

Respuesta 6:
When it's ajar.

Respuesta 7:
Answering the literal question: Fields are always fields, but sometimes they can be very small and even without any connected cities.

(Yes, the cities are touching and block the field from that point. Can't say from the image whether they are still connected around the other city.)

Respuesta 8:
its a break, but the tile is slightly misprinted/cut

Respuesta 9:
The city segments are considered to go to the corners even if the print & cut don't perfectly line up. It is a break so there are 2 different fields.



Tema 28: Placing tiles by Monastery
Pregunta:

My husband and I played Carcasomme for the first time. When placing Monasteries, can you place, for example, a road tile by just attaching the land portions of the two tiles even though the road isn't attached to anything?
You must place tiles so that they correspond to the currently placed tiles (field to field, road to road, city to city).
Thus, if a tile doesn't violate any rules, you can attach it field to field even if there are some other elements on it (roads, cities, etc)

Respuesta 2:
Welcome Suzanne.
Just to repeat in slightly different words what Boris said:
All you need worry about when placing tiles are the edges of tiles already on the board. Corners do not matter. Nor does empty space.

You must match your tile to existing tile/s. field to field. Road to Road. City to City.

Respuesta 3:
Thank you Boris for the clarification! I was playing correctly.

Respuesta 4:
Thank you..it makes sense now. Wanted to confirm we were playing right.



Tema 29: Monastry tiles placement base game

Thanks!
No it is not. When placing an Abbey tile it must be placed so that each of the four sides touch another piece. Think of it as filling in a hole. The rules for the Abbey state that one is given to each player at the beginning of the game. If playing with two or three players or if you had multiple copies you could give multiples to each player. Even then they could only be placed diagonal to each other.

Plus this should be in the Abbey and Mayor forums.

Respuesta 3:
Just to avoid possible future confusion (edit: Ah, ninja'd by Brett with an example of said confusion ) the tile shown below is a monastery (it was called a cloister in the first edition).

You may play multiple monasteries next to each other. If a meeple is placed on a monastery it can score 9 points if the monastery is completed.

Abbey tiles are found in the Abbey & Mayor  expansion.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks for the reply David!

Hello Brett,

Thanks for your reply but my question is concerning the abbey tiles in the base game not in the expansions. Do you know of that rule in the base game?

Respuesta 6:
Thanks for the precision. I was indeed translating from my french rulebook and the name might be different in english.

So if I put two monastries next to one another and put my meeple on both should I count the 9 points for both monastry for a total of 18 points?

They score separately, but both could indeed score 9 points if all 10 tiles surrounding them both are filled in.

Each monastery requires a meeple. I am not sure I am reading your statement correctly but felt like that needed to be clarified. And of course you only score a monastery when it's completed, or score it partially at the end of the game.

Tema 31: Question regarding Messengers
Pregunta:
In the new 2021 big box set, the rules state the following:
Quote:
You can only draw message tiles when your scoring meeple and messenger are alone.
If another player's scoring meeple or messenger is on a dark space when you land there, you do not draw a message tile.
This to me is contradicting.
Can I draw a tile when my meeple lands on the same dark space as my messenger?

On the one hand no, because it isn't alone. But on the other hand yes, because it doesn't belong to an opponent.

It seems weird to add the second clause at all if no, because it wouldn't be alone regardles of whose unit was present on the space.

Note: This (according to Wikicarpedia) seems to be a Z-Man addition (it's written in a footnote), but the big box is clearly labelled with the Hans im Glück logo, which suggests to me it's been officially adopted By HiG.

Respuesta 1:
My guess is that the second sentence helpfully clarifies the first. That is, "alone" in that context means "no other player's pieces there."

Respuesta 2:
HiG has logo on all oficially published Carcassonne games. They don't control translation of rules and sometimes publishes adding some crazy stuff. Like this one.

For example in Czech/Slovak translation of The Princess and The Dragon (Expansion 3) rules are, that Fairy is not possible to place to Large Meeple, Mayor or Wagon.

There is official logo of HiG on that box, but it was just bad understanding of translator of original rules.

When you will ask HiG for clarification, they will say - German rules are core rules and rules which are valid. So if it's not in German rules - it's just translation addition.

That book is riddled with weird errors, such as crop circles stating you can't choose the action if you don't have the corresponding meeple to do it with, but in another booklet in another language included in the box, it simply states the same it does in English: That even if you don't have a meeple on a given feature, you must still declare the action...

Just an FYI

Our group of 4 players found it difficult to play with Messengers ( or The Robbers ) when the scoreboard was on the side of the table, next to two of the players and further away from the other two of the players. So we created our own fan-expansion to the game, a scoreboard center start tile!



Don’t try to print that image, it is too small. Here is the link to the webpage we created so you can just print one of more of our predesigned start tiles, or create your own using the BYO link at the bottom of the first page.

Create your own tile

The key is to use the supplied empty, just outline, page to adjust your word processor and printer to create an exactly 4 tile by 6 tile properly sized printout, then do exactly the same thing with the start tile that you select or create for yourself.

After you create the image, glue it to the cardboard on the back of a legal pad, then use an exacto knife to trim it to size, (exactly 4 tiles by 6 tiles).

When I started talking about the Messengers and Robbers on the Carcassonne Central forum, someone did send me a copy of a C1 version of a center scoreboard. I'm not sure where this image comes from.



When I posted that to my thread, everyone asked for a C2 version so I created the Build Your Own process for C2 and also created 4 pre-made versions for quick download. River 1, River 2, Basic Game, and Inns and Cathedrals versions. OR, you can follow the instructions and Build Your Own.

Our group has gotten so used to the center scoreboards that we now play with one of them even when we are not playing the Messenger or Robber expansions.



Tema 32: Does this tile count as two or four farms?
Pregunta:
In the rivers expansion is a tile which depicts two one edge city segments with a city running between them. There are tiny slivers of grass visible between the cities and the river.

Question is whether this tiny sliver of grass is enough to count the two halves as connected or not.

Note: I undestand that rivers divide farms, the question isn't about the river, but about the tiny patch of land seemingly connecting either side of the cities.

Going by one interpretation It's either two farms (divided by the river only), or four farms (divided by both the cities and the river)

Tema 33: The Tower with Phantoms
Pregunta:
The Tower rules are specific for placing your meeple: You can place it as usual OR place a Tower Floor on an empty base or on top of another floor OR you can place your meeple on top of a stack of floors to close that tower.

The on-line chat about placing your Phantom goes in two directions! In the non-Tower chats it is clear that you place your Phantom the same way you place a meeple, BUT in the Tower discussions they only mention placing the Phantom as usual or on top of a stack of floors to close it. There is no discussion of placing another Tower Floor instead of placing your Phantom.

Does this mean that I can place a second Floor and capture another meeple OR that I actually have to place the Phantom itself?

Respuesta 1:
So you want to be able to, as the second placement the Phantom would allow you, place a Tower piece instead of the Phantom and keep the Phantom in your supply? That doesn't seem reasonable at all.

Respuesta 2:
I would reason it like this:
You can place a meeple AND a phantom (if you choose so) per Phantom rules (in other words, you can place a phantom meeple as an addition to a regular turn)
You can either place a meple by normal rules OR a tower piece per Tower rules (in other words, you "move wood" - doing either stuff)

Combining two, I would say you can:
Place a regular meeple per normal rules and NOT place a phantom meeple
Place a tower piece (move wood) per Tower rules and NOT place a phantom meeple
Place a regular meeple per normal rules and place a phantom meeple per Phantom rules of an additional placement
Place a tower piece (move wood) per Tower rules and place a phantom meeple on the most recent tile per Phantom rules

So, you first have a normal turn and THEN you have a phantom turn by placing THE phantom itself. Phantom doesn't grant you the ability to do two turns at once and place both a regular meeple and a tower piece. It simply adds a +1 phantom turn only

But I understand where your logic comes from, even though it doesn't thematically fit with the phantom concept.

What Carpedia only mentions:
The phantom can be placed as second figure to neutral figure such as a tower piece.
A phantom can also be played to areas such as a tower – the phantom is not restricted to placement on the tile that was just placed. (11/2013)
You can place a follower at an open tower to close it, and then place the phantom into an area which is safe now because the tower is closed.

Not sure I understand that last sentence. If what you are saying is that you can place a tower base tile, then place your meeple on the base to close it, then place your Phantom on the tile “because the tower is closed”, I think that is against the rules. My understanding is that closing a tower can only be done by placing a meeple on top of a Tower Floor, not directly on the empty Tower Base.

Nope, it means what it means – closing a pre-existing tower. The emphasis is exactly for the order of play – first you finish and close the tower with your regular meeple, then you place your phantom meeple to the tile placed, not fearing to be removed



Tema 34: Abandoned monasteries or gardens
Pregunta:
If an abbot is removed from monastery or garden before being completely surrounded and takes say 6 points can a subsequent player place their abbot on the monastery or garden to complete it and ultimately take 9 points

Respuesta 1:
No. Because you can only place a meeple onto the tile you just placed.

One of the expansions adds a "Magic Portal" mechanic that allows you to place your meeple onto an incomplete feature somewhere else on the board, so that would allow you to do what you describe.

But in the basic game, no.

Respuesta 2:
No, neither can an abbot be removed from a monastery before it is complete, nor can anyone place a new meeple on a tile other than the one that has just been placed.

(This is for the basic rules. Some later extensions allow just that but then it is explicitly described in the expansion rules.)

Respuesta 3:
Markus Söllner
@markussoellner
No, neither can an abbot be removed from a monastery before it is complete
The Abbot meeple can be removed before completion of the monastery or garden, it's one of the special meeples with it's own rule(s) like the Builder.

Just note Karyn that the rules of removing your Abbot from the monastery/garden only applies to the Abbot. If I place a regular meeple on a monastery, it's locked there until completion.

Respuesta 4:
Besides the magic portal, the major and the abbey expansion allows you to take it too with the "car" that jumps

Respuesta 5:
There is also the possibility of using the flying machines expansion. That expansion could provide you with the opportunity of landing on an non completed monastery/garden and claim it.



Tema 35: Official Solo - how to play coop?
Pregunta:
Hi again,

In the official solo rules there is a subtitle at the top that reads "also playable as a cooperative challenge".

But nowhere does it explain how this should work? I've searched all the forums and can't find any references to coop with the official solo rules.

Or does it just mean you and x many others can just debate together where the best place for tiles would be etc. That seems wrong and hardly worth mentioning in that prominent subtitle.

How do others interpret this/play this as a coop game?

Cheers
Oliver

Respuesta 1:
I would use the "Knizia scoring" for co-op. The score for the play is the lowest score of all of the players.

Respuesta 2:
I'll have to search what that means. But that's just scoring right? How does one actually play coop? Again, I'm interested what the intent of the official solo rules was for coop.

Respuesta 3:
My thought is that you play co-op with exactly the same rules as normally, score normally, and then collectively record a "final score" being the lowest of the individual players' scores. The end scoring will encourage/force the players to co-operate and try to boost the scores of the player(s) that (seem to) have the least points.

Instead of blocking, the players will help each other find the "correct" tiles to get the maximum of points, and help players "worm into" big cities sharing the most possible points.

Respuesta 4:
Hey @a1bert,

Thanks for that. That really explains what I was missing/not understanding. I'll give it a go with my 12-year old. I'm sure he'll prefer the variant where he gets to annoy me hahaha

Tema 36: Official Solo - understanding "if there is a free feature"
Pregunta:
Hi.

Just want to make sure I'm playing the solo version correctly. In the rules it says:
"...you must place a meeple, if there is a free feature on the tile. If there is more than one free feature on the tile, you can decide which one to place it on".

My green meeple's turn just placed this tile.


So there are two places I could place my green meeple.
1. In the city where I will share points (if one of the colours is last).
2. The road.

My question is. What constitutes a free feature? That is, is 1. above legal or is 2. the only option here (i.e. the road).

Cheers
Oliver

Respuesta 1:
With complete lack of knowledge of the actual solo rules:
1. You can't place a meeple legally in the city segment. It's already occupied, so not a "free" feature.
2. There is no meeple on the road, so it is a free feature.

Do the solo rules count fields? I can't say from the image if that's a valid place for the meeple.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks @a1bert.

Probably best to check out the solo rules first. They are here.
https://www.hans-im-glueck.de/_Resources/Persistent/5e28ae92...

A few notes.
* there are no farmers allowed
* you are allowed to play multiple colours in the same city. It's covered in the scoring section.

Cheers
Oliver

Respuesta 3:
Solo rules are consistent with normal play (apart from the no farmers rule) and therefore you cannot place a meeple in the city in the OP's example.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks Stuart. You are right.
Tricky because I've only ever played the solo rules so far but just checked the main rules.

Tema 37: What are the Official Rules?
Pregunta:
tvis without the @ just made a reply to a thread by Spectre_x13 that I think needs to become its own thread!

I never realized that the BGG Web Links existed, and I definitely did not realize that there are 24 versions of the rules, and that 5 of the links refer to “Official , Rules”.

BGG Web Links


AND that WikiCarPedia is the eight link in the list and does not even include the word “Official”.

So, where are the “Official Rules”.

Our group of four players started playing Carcassonne in June of 2021 and we created our own website for the rules we play by in September and update the website monthly!

Let me give just one example of our group looking for an “Official Rule”.

We purchase a Nordic version of Expansion 3: The Princess and the Dragon in early January 2022. The printed rules that came with the expansion clearly said that the dragon moved in phase 1a. The Z-man games on line PDF said that the dragon moved in phase 1b. Both printed versions of the rules seemed to indicate that the dragon moved during the phase when you draw the dragon tile, before or after, placing it on the board.

This seemed logical to us, the movement of the dragon happens completely at random basically between two player’s turns.

But the chat on line was determined to move the dragon in phase 2b, after placing a meeple and moving the fairy which gives the player who draws a dragon tile almost complete control over the movement!

Please do not continue the discussion of this Dragon example!

I think we all want the answer to the real question: Is there a set of Official Rules for the Carcassonne game, and where are they? OR, do we all get to make up our own rules?

Carc rules have been subject to so much revision from edition to edition that players are basically forced to choose one as a standard, which creates a kind of higher-order house ruling. I guess the latest published version of the rules applies to organized competitions?

There are several official rules depending on the publisher.

Use the rules that come with your game, or the corresponding publisher's rules.

This is where the problems come into play! When two of us were looking for the Dragon and Princess expansion, one ordered a Nordic version and the other found an English version. The translated Nordic rules did not match the English rules. . . Then the Wiki page talked about both versions and came up with a third version of the rules!

Don’t remember the rule in question for this second example, but the ZMG printed rules did not match what was displayed on WikiCarPedia, then we found a PDF file on the ZMG website that agreed with Wiki, but did not agree with their printed version.

Quite often we get together for game night and the first thing we have to talk about is what rules we are going to use for the next game!

Respuesta 7:
the rules in my base game say that the rules are subject to modification based upon whatevr expansions are in play. So, I go by the base rules I have and the expansion(s) in play at that time. given that I have most of the expansions there's a few things we confirm on scoring before we start because depending which combo we play with it could vary. If there's arguement then we decide as a group but that's rare. The instance you have with the dragon order to me is a which goes first of a multiple things happen at once scenario and in which case we lean toward the "spirit of the rules" rather than the "letter of the rules."

The “official” rules are those published in German by Hans im Glück. They are the only ones that matter if you want what was originally intended by the original publisher. Wikicarpedia is designed to be accurate translations of the German rules, with any substantial differences discussed in the footnotes. The English editions especially have been subject to numerous translation errors over the years so can’t really be trusted as “official.”
Thanks for the reply, I just want to be sure of the meaning of your last sentence.

You were talking about WikiCarPedia being an accurate translation, then you said that the English editions were subject to errors. Let me be sure! What you were saying is that the printed rules that come with the English versions of the games have a number of errors and that the WikiCarPedia version is correct and that the footnotes on the WikiCarPedia website explain the English printed rule errors.

Bottom line, the WikiCarPedia website is best place to find accurate English Rules!

Respuesta 12:
Yes, Wikicarpedia is a better source than the printed English rules.

Wikicarpedia is a peer reviewed translation of the official rules, while many of the translated rules were done by one or two people who maybe didn’t even play the game. The worst translations are the English rules included with many Hans im Glück promo expansions—they’re written by non-native English speakers and usually have second language learner errors, which sometimes impacts rules interpretation.

What are the Official Rules?
I mostly interpret "Official" as a distinction between those rules specifically offered by the particular publisher, in contrast with rules perhaps translated or re-stated by another party.

That may have had greater meaning in the early years of BGG, when:

** games may have required other parties to translate from publisher's German
** the availablity of proper PDF documents was much less prominent or convenient

tvis without the @ just made a reply to a thread by Spectre_x13 that I think needs to become its own thread!

I never realized that the BGG Web Links existed, . . .
I forget how it used to be presented on the game's main page, but I definitely remember being discouraged when a page re-design placed it less prominently as a sub-menu pick beneath the "More" selection.

Finding RULES is an important part of my BGG experience. RULES are a crucial part of my own game selection process.



Tema 38: List of illegal moves?
Pregunta:
Hi all. I see multiple questions with many asking, "can I do this or that". I recently bought the game and although the rules are straightforward, it doesn't seem to clarify what are the "illegal moves" which has led me to some doubts regarding tile placement. Is there a consolidated list somewhere? Do tiles always have to match with their corresponding feature or can they be placed to complete another feature even if the tiles around it are then incomplete? Say a road ends up touching a field but completes another road.

Respuesta 1:
There are four edges to a tile. When played, each edge must match whatever it joins to. If I am understanding this question:

There is only one illegal move when placing a tile: Placing a tile so that any side at all doesn't match the tile it touches. In other words, every side that a tile touches must match fully. Roads must meet roads, fields must meet fields, cities must meet cities. (Of course, not every side needs to touch another tile, but at least one must.)

Respuesta 3:
Thank you. You all understood me correctly and this is the doubt I was having. I guess there isn't so much as an extensive list as opposed to the one rule that cannot be broken as mentioned by you all, feature must match feature wherever it touches but not necessarily does each tile edge need to touch another tile edge.

I'm going to give it another go at this game tonight with my wife. We may have played this incorrectly. I also tried the solo variant and apparently made mistakes there too. I'm loving the simplicity of this game. This along with Cascadia have been the best gateway games for my wife.

1.Draw a tile.
2.Place a tile.
3.Optionally place a meeple on the placed tile.
4.Score all completed features. Return meeples.
All completed features are scored, regardless of their owners.
If you do that, you'll be able to handle the vast majority of situations that you encounter!

Our group of 4 started playing in June of 2021, so we are relatively new to the game.

From what we can gather, the relative authority on the rules is WikiCarPedia. Their basic pages go into just about every rule and the footnotes on their pages go into depth when you are playing with multiple expansions. Best way is to start with what you are comfortable with, then slowly add the expansions that everyone in your group agrees with.

The URL for WikiCarPedia is: https://wikicarpedia.com/

From our research, there are only 9 individuals in the world who are allowed to modify the English Rule for the game, and there are others who can modify the rule in various other languages.

. . . Do tiles always have to match with their corresponding feature . . .
My own opinion is that the contemporary rules from Z-Man Games are written much less precisely than earlier Rio Grande Games. Nonetheless, the answer is present.

Example quotes here with my highlight come from different places in the rules; from Roads and from Cities, respectively


1. Placing a tile
You draw the depicted tile with three road segments
starting from a village. You must place it in such a way that
it continues the existing landscape (the tiles already in play).


Of course, the illustration must be continued as well. For
example, a city segment must be connected to an open city.

Consider, also, looking at the older rules from Rio Grande Games for support.

This is one of the topics that our group discusses on our personal Carcassonne website:

The Next Move Strategy


When you start playing Carcassonne your primary thoughts are what to do with the tile you just drew. As you continue to play the game you start thinking like, if I place this tile this way, what tile will I need for my next move, and then you start thinking about how you can affect your opponent’s next move tile!

Your Next Move and your opponents Next Move will be more difficult if the Next Move Tile has to match 2 sides instead just 1, 3 sides instead of just 2, and 4 sides instead of just 3 makes it extremely difficult!

Tema 39: Another player places a tile that completes one of my Cities. Do I score it? If so, when?
Pregunta:
Another player places a tile that completes one of my Cities. Do I score it? If so, when?

I have a meeple in a City, and another player lays down a tile that completed that City.
When the player does this. My City is closed with my meeple in it.

I'm assuming I score that City. Correct?

Then, WHEN do I score it?
After the other player decides whether to lay down a meeple or not? At the end of this player's turn.
Or on my turn?
It's easier imo to just do it at the same time he would score his turn so that I, or any other player in the same situation, doesn't forget about scoring the City and retrieving the meeple.

You score it after the other player has placed the tile, opted to place a Meeple or not, and then everything that can score, scores now. If you were part of the scoring, any meeples involved in that scoring come back to you immediately.

Z-Man games edition of the rules (currently on their website, I found the pdf after 15 seconds of google searching):
Page 3:
"(...) Starting with the first player, the current player does the following actions in the order listed below, after which it is the next player’s turn, and so on and so forth. (...) So what are these actions?
1. Placing a tile: The player must draw exactly 1 Land tile from a stack and place it faceup to continue the landscape.
2. Placing a meeple: The player may place a meeple from her supply onto the tile she has just placed.
3. Scoring a feature: The player must score any feature completed by her tile placement."

Respuesta 7:
Yes, if you hold the majority, or tied for the majority, of meeples on that city, you score the points as soon as your opponent places the tile, and your meeple is returned to your stack.

If you are also playing with Expansion 2, Traders and Builders, you do not get the builder tokens, you get the points, but the player who closed the city get the tokens. And, if you have your builder on the city that was closed, you do not get an extra turn and your builder is also returned to your stack.

It costs nothing to be polite and it’s great to be helpful, but I do think there’s at least half a point here. This isn’t the same as sitting round a table with your friends playing a game that you’ve explained to them. Not the same at all. In that situation, it’s natural, easy and quick to ask for a simple clarification.

On forums like these, it’s fair to have an expectation that anyone asking a question will have done their basic research. And that means searching the forums, the rule book and any collateral (e.g. text on cards, player boards, etc) and including any part you find unclear when asking the question, and not really asking a question which has an obvious answer.

Of course, not everyone has a copy of the game they’re asking about and not everyone knows how easy it is to find rules online, so we shouldn’t be surprised that simple questions get asked. I think it’s reasonable to include a gentle reminder that it’s easy to answer these sorts of questions yourself in the reply.

And I think we should be quick to forgive a (slightly) dismissive response. It’s easy to get frustrated and dash off something like this. We’ve all done it (and we don’t always recognise it when we do and apologise preemptively). The alternative is forums full of repetitive questions that don’t add much of anything meaningful. Part of the purpose of the forum is the real-time question&answer thing, but another very valid part is a record of previous questions&answers that can be re-read in future.

I agree completely on the first underlined point. Likewise the second. However, whilst some might find it 'natural, easy and quick' to ask for a simple clarification in person but not online, other people find the two pretty much interchangeable.

I have to wonder what our collective definition of 'forums like these' is? I don't have the expectation that anyone asking a question will have done all those things or even necessarily any of them. Sure most people will have done some but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't help the minority who either haven't done any research or have but are none the wiser.

If people were all 100% effective in their own research there would be almost no questions and we would miss the opportunity to share our enthusiasm for our favourite games that leads us to respond to other people's questions in the first place. I think it's reasonable to hope that if a community member finds a question 'too simple' such that they feel the need to be dismissive it's probably best to just leave it for someone else to answer.

Again I agree completely with the underlined section. Certainly there's no need to 'pile on' to the original dismissive commenter. (And yes, I've certainly made dismissive responses too, but I don't see that as a benefit or feel good about it.) However I strongly disagree that the alternative (to educating posters, dismissively or otherwise) is a forum full of repetitive questions. If the OP has learnt anything from this exchange - over and above the answer to their question - it's that some parts of this community will judge them by the nature of the questions they ask. (Which might well lead to less future questions from them but I don't see that as a benefit.) I would prefer we strive for a community where there is 'no such thing as a stupid question'. It might lead to just a few more repetitions of simple questions but hopefully it would lead to a more welcoming community to all (and perhaps fewer threads derailed by discussions such as this ).

Contemporary rules from Z-Man Games are less precise than earlier English rules from Rio Grande Games, as quoted below (bold as printed; highlight is mine).

Players take turns in clockwise order beginning with the starting player. On a player's turn, he executes the
following actions in the order shown:

* The player must draw and place a new land tile.
* The player may deploy one of his followers from his supply to the land tile he just placed.
* If, by placing the land tile, cloisters, roads, and/or cities are completed, they are now scored.
The player’s turn is over and the next player, in clockwise order, takes his turn in the same manner

Tema 41: River: "no U-turn": what does that mean?
Pregunta:
We're playing the 2016 Z-Man edition of the game.

The rules for the River (printed on a separate addendum which also contains rules for the Abbot and for scoring farms) says that "the river cannot turn twice in the same direction because this would create a u-turn."

But the illustration immediately to the right shows exactly that: a u-turn. After 'descending' from the top, the river first turns to its left, goes straight a space, then turns to the right, straight a space, and promptly turns right AGAIN, before then turning left and ending in the lake. So it makes a u-turn.

What am I missing?
Thanks in advance!

Respuesta 1:
We interpreted it to mean that you must be able to place at least one tile between the two parallel stretches of river. In the situation above, it is legal because it extends straight one square before making its U-turn; to not have this space would mean 4 river squares in a 2x2 grid, the outlawing of which I believe is the spirit of the rule.

Respuesta 2:
There's some debate here on the forums. Some say that if the last turn was to the right, the next turn must be to the left, regardless of straight tiles in between (thus, not subsequent turns in the same direction). Others say that there can be two turns to the left as long as there is a straight tile in between (this, not subsequent turns in the same direction).

Even the official digital implementations of the game disagree (Android uses the former while iOS uses the latter).

So, I guess it's up to House Rule, as long as it's not two turns to the same direction in adjacent tiles.

Respuesta 3:
Given the lack of consensus, I think if the less restrictive interpretation doesn't create unplayable situations, it's preferable.

Respuesta 4:
We take it that the river can't turn in the same direction twice right after each other. Taken literally "twice in the same direction" would mean there can be only two turns total in the river -- one 90-degree clockwise and one 90-degree anticlockwise, which is not the case.

The "top-level" rule is: you can't create a situation which would make placing the next random river segment impossible.

(Edit: Also based on the above, you can argue that only two consequtive tiles turning into the same direction makes an U-turn. If there are tiles between, it is something else.)

This isn't stated in the rules. I think where Xavier (@turmoil23) is getting this is from what many of us think is "the spirit of the rule," like Andrew (@vangamer1578) referenced.

Tema 42: Does the Tower base terminate Roads?

Footnote 4 for the Tower expansion is very specific: “Tower foundations and towers built on top are separate features from roads, cities and fields. Towers are not part of any of the features they stand on or "touch" (they are not part of a city or field touching them), so there is no interaction between them:”

Looking at 4 of the tower expansion tiles:

Towers are not part of any of the features they stand on or "touch" (they are not part of a city or field touching them), so there is no interaction between them:”

Looking at 4 of the tower expansion tiles:



I assume that the road on the first tile continues to the city so there are two fields on that tile. As for the other 3 tower tiles; Does the tower base terminate the road segments and divide the tiles into multiple roads and fields?
The way I read that, the tower base is a separate feature which divides both fields and roads. So in the first picture, the road does not continue to the city (this matters for the wagon, for example) but the tower base also divides the fields, so yes, there are 2 fields on that tile. The seond tile also has 2 fields, the third has 3 and the fourth has 4.

Respuesta 3:
Actually, for the wagon, it depends where the wagon is. If the location of the wagon is one of the eight adjacent tiles, then it may move to the city, as long as the city is incomplete and unoccupied.

This reply didn't make any sense to me, so I went to WikiCarpedia to look up the wagon, to see what I was missing...

And it turns out they completely changed the way the wagon works at some point!

In my older rules, the wagon can only move to an adjacent incomplete feature - so from a road to another road or a city or cloister that the road directly connects to, or vice versa.

In the new rules, the wagon can move to any incomplete feature on the same or an adjacent tile - the features themselves don't have to conect directly.

So by my rules, you could not move the wagon from the road to the city in the first tile shown above, because the tower base is in the way. But by the rules you presumably have, you could do so, because it's on the same tile!

They really do like to make it confusing, don't they.



Tema 43: One point roads?
Pregunta:
(First of all - sry if I use the wrong terminology - I've never played Carcassone with rules in English)

If I draw a road tile with a village in the middle (a road stop), and one/some of the roads lead/-s to a city on that tile - may I put a meeple on that "mini road" and collect one point? (I mean that the "crossroad" and the city share the same tile, see picture, second tile in second row).

Tema 44: Empty finished city
Pregunta:
I'm not sure if a city can be scored if it has no meeples/knights. The player on his turn had no meeples to play. He completed a city by placing a tile. The city had no meeples at any point. Is the move legal? Is the city scored? If it is not scored, can it be claimed by another player? Is it just left empty?

Respuesta 1:
The play would be legal, but there would be no score for it. The city would still count for Farms at the end of the game.

Respuesta 2:
Features can be completed without anyone scoring for them. It happens all the time when Roads are completed. Players are never obligated to claim anything, so Monasteries and Cities can also be left vacant, and in the former case not even possible to be claimed in the future (outside certain expansions).

However, if a player has a Meeple and places a tile that completes a Road or City, they can claim the feature and then immediately return their Meeple. This is because a tile is placed and Meeple can be placed before scoring occurs. Therefore it is possible to complete a feature, claim it, and score it on the same turn. Note: This is only possible if the player has a Meeple available at the beginning of their turn. Any Meeples returned during a turn are returned during the scoring phase, so they cannot be used during the Meeple placement phase.

As John said, completed features still count for Farms at the end of the game (and can have other effects in expansions).

Respuesta 3:
Other players would never be able to claim a closed city. The only way to claim the city would be to put a meeple on it, and the only time you can do that is when the tile is placed.

Respuesta 4:
Let me add to this question!

The scoring image on the Wiki Castle page is:


OK, let's say that someone just used a tower to kill the Blue meeple that is on this city, then on your red turn, you draw the illustrated tile, but you have no meeples at the start of your turn. If you place that tile where shown, the city will score zero because there are no meeples on it, it would have scored 16 points if could have placed a meeple.

So the question is, would you still score 16 points for your Castle even though no one scores any points for the "first completed feature" in the fief of your Castle?

Yes, because it was the first completed feature. There’s no requirement for anyone to have a meeple on that feature.



Tema 45: River and farms
Pregunta:
Does the river has the same effect as a road in calculating the farm borders?

Respuesta 1:
Hi there!

I guess your question is whether rivers separate farms. If you meant it this way, yes, they do, just like roads.

Respuesta 2:
Farms are delimited by the river. But note that the field goes around the pond and spring.

Respuesta 3:
Yes, this is what I meant. Thanks!!!

Respuesta 4:
All of what has been said so far is correct, the river does separate farm land, and the farm does wrap around the pond and spring that comes with the current big box game.

Just as a separate side note: If you can get copies of the River II tiles that were originally released in 2005 and later bundled with the Court, King and Robber expansion in 2008 . . .

This alternate set of river tiles that includes a fork tile so the river can go in three directions, not just two, and one of the pond tiles also include the edge of a city and the farm does not wrap around that tile.

There are numerous sets of house rules on the ways that you can combine River I and River II tiles to create more complex rivers when you start playing with the tiles from multiple expansions.



Tema 46: Castle Scoring
Pregunta:
A Castle is scored when a neighboring feature is scored. What happens when the scoring tile is not even part of the Castle’s original 6 tile neighborhood tiles?

If Red creates a castle hoping the Blue city will be completed for at least 16 points, but, one of the 6 neighboring tiles spaces empty …



Then, Yellow fills the empty space with a tile that completes a 2 point road …



As I understand the rules, Yellow’s tile becomes a Neighboring tile and the Road becomes a completed neighboring feature, so Red is forced to score the castle for only 2 points. The fact that the Yellow tile did not even exist before it became a neighboring feature makes no difference!

Also, if I am reading the rules correctly, Red will get just 2 points even if Yellow decides to place a meeple on the City portion of the new tile and nobody scores the insta-2 points for the completed road, except for Red who then has to remove the Red meeple from the Castle!

Is this correct by the rules?

Yes, you've got it. Placing a meeple on a castle is a bit of a gamble for that reason. But it will usually score more than the 4 you'd have got for the 2-tile city, so it's generally worthwhile.

By the way, this should be in the forums for Carcassonne: Expansion 8 – Bridges, Castles and Bazaars.

Firstly, this belongs in the forums for the expansion, not the base game. I've flagged the thread to ask a mod to move it.

Assuming you mean the original English rules (published by Rio Grande), yes, they're here in the files section.

Note that the word "follower" is used in those rules where more recent versions use the term "meeple" (which was invented by a player and later adopted by the publishers).

Respuesta 2:
I see that elsewhere  you've been asking about turn order when placing the dragon, so I'll point out that these original rules clearly state that you get to place a meeple after placing the tile, and then the game is paused while the dragon moves.

Tema 48: Who changed the Dragon rules and why?
Pregunta:
Every move in the game of Carcassonne happens in 3 phases:
1. Place a tile, 2. Place a meeple and 3. Score a feature

The printed rules for the Expansion 3: The Princess and the Dragon clearly defines the movement of the Dragon as phase 1b. If you draw a Dragon tile:

1. You place your tile.
1b. The dragon moves and eats the meeples on 6 tiles.
2. You place a meeple or move the Fairy.
3. You score any completed features.

Under the standard rules, each player’s decision to not place a meeple on their turn so they can move the Fairy to protect one of their meeples from the Dragon was a strategic decision.

For some unknown reason, the WikiCarPedia website decided to change moving the dragon from phase 1b to phase 2b which changes the order of play to: If you draw a Dragon tile

1. You place your tile.
2. You place a meeple or move the Fairy.
2b. The dragon moves and eats the meeples on 6 tiles.
3. You score any completed features.

Under the modified rules, the Fairy strategy is hardly worth consideration because the player who draws the Dragon tile has full control of where the Fairy is before the Dragon moves.

Respuesta 1:
The rules that came with my (Rio Grande) copy say "Whenever a player draws a tile showing a dragon figure, he places it as he would normally place a tile, and may also place a follower on the tile as he normally could. Then, the game is briefly interrupted while the Dragon moves!" So we've always played it in that order: place tile, place or move meeple, move dragon, score features.

While I agree that the Fairy would gain importance if you weren't able to move it before the Dragon, I'm not convinced that encouraging players to trade the Fairy back and forth more often would be a good thing. But then again, I haven't tried it that way.

Respuesta 2:
I will add that according to a note on another wikicarpedia page, the printed Z-Man Games version of the rules misinterpreted the original printed Rio Grand Games rule about when the dragon moved.

The wikicarpedia page was originally created in Jan 2019 with the Z-Man rules but was modified shortly after to match the original RGG rules.

Respuesta 3:
And there are apparently other versions of the rules where you move the dragon after scoring any completed features. So the rules about when the dragon moved are all over the place. Wikicarpedia had chosen the RGG rules as correct. The Carcassonne fandom wiki says the dragon moved after scoring features.

So I guess play it however you like because there are printed rules out there you can point to and say you are playing it as printed.

Respuesta 4:
Our group of 4 players has only been playing Carcassonne since June 2021. When I personally tried to find The Princess and the Dragon in November, an English version was unavailable, so I ordered a Nordic version. It came with 3 sets of rules in 3 languages, Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish. All 3 printed rules said that the “The Dragon flies” happens as phase 1a! So, as of January 2022, the printed rules for this expansion say that the dragon moves BEFORE the player who draws the Dragon tile gets to either place a meeple or move the Fairy.

I’ve also downloaded what is described as the English version of the expansion rules, and in that PDF, the movement of the dragon happens as phase 1b.

The only place where I see the movement of the dragon happening as phase 2b is the WikiCarPedia website. If the rules were really changed, why did my January 2022 Nordic rules say it was phase 1a?

If the printed rules are wrong, why aren’t the being changed?

Respuesta 5:
Here is the link to the Z-man Games rules:

https://images.zmangames.com/filer_public/da/30/da30ce4e-814...

Page 2 of the printed rules clearly show that the movement of the Dragon is phase 1b. The movement of the dragon should happen BEFORE the player who drew the Dragon tile gets to phase 2, deploy meeple or move the Fairy!

Respuesta 6:
In the rules you linked, page 2 says, "Dragon tiles are placed exactly like those in the base game. Unlike Volcano tiles, you are allowed to place a meeple on a Dragon tile. Then... the dragon moves!" The order seems pretty clear to me.

Respuesta 7:
Yes, that rule is clear, but on the WikiCarPedia page for this expansion, they changed the phase of the dragon movement from 1b to 2b. The Dragon now moves after the player who drew the Dragon tile make their Place a Meeple phase, which also allows that player to not place a meeple so they can move the Fairy.

Basically, instead of each player making a strategic decision each turn to either deploy a meeple of move the Fairy, moving the Fairy DOES NOT protect your meeple from the dragon, because only the player who draws the Dragon tile has the last word on where the Fairy is.

@PapaGeek2
If the printed rules are wrong, why aren’t the being changed?
This game has always been plagued by rules "interpretations." The main source was that the German version went through various "editions" and minor changes occurred. Rio Grande didn't always keep up with the changes and so their version never seemed to be up to date with what the "real" version was.

This was exacerbated by expansions were Hans im Gluck was designed based on the current rules and RGG was continually making changes based on their interpretation of the rules. At one point, it finally clicked for RGG that they had to change when one of the expansions came out. If Z-man used RGG as a basis for the rules, that is somewhat of a shame. They should have done their own translation.

All that to say, play what most makes sense to you. If you feel changing something makes it a better experience for your group, do it that way.

Respuesta 9:
Let me make a final suggestion.

So what if moving the Dragon is step 1a in the Nordic community and 1b in the English speaking world. It is still part of phase 1 and therefore happens before you place any meeples. Why not work on that!

The answer to this issue is actually very simple. The Dragon symbol on a drawn tile triggers the movement of the Dragon before anything else in the player’s turn.

Phase 0: Draw the tile and notice the Dragon symbol. The dragon immediately starts moving up to 6 times.
Phase 1: Placing a Tile
Phase 2: Placing a Meeple
Phase 3: Scoring a Feature

This way the movement of the Dragon is not part of any player’s turn. It happens between the turns of two players and none of the players have any control over how or when the dragon moves.

If you look at the 12 Dragon tiles, they are just like a variety of tiles in the base game. There are cities and roads and monasteries and even a garden. If you make the change that I just suggested, after the Dragon moves (between turns) the player places the otherwise normal looking tile just like a normal tile. The Dragon symbol only effects what happens between turns, not what happens on anyone’s actual turn!

Respuesta 10:
The current "Order of Play" on the WikiCarPedia website for Phase 1: Placing a tile



Step 1A: Begin Turn

There are no particular actions for this step.

Step 1B: Draw a Tile

a. Randomly draw a tile.
b. Show the tile to all players.
c. Perform any special actions related to this tile.

Step 1C: Place the Tile

a. Place the tile. If the placement is illegal, you must discard the tile and go back to Step 1B.
b. Note: any tile-based feature that is finished is considered complete at this time.

Item 1Bc is what I added

Respuesta 11:
Sandy Bittman
@PapaGeek2
Yes, that rule is clear, but on the WikiCarPedia page for this expansion, they changed the phase of the dragon movement from 1b to 2b.
I feel this rule isn't clear quite yet.

If one reads the contents of Phase 1 for the dragon it now includes moving the fairy when placing the volcano tile, or placing a meeple/moving the fairy when playing a dragon tile. Then Phase 1b moves the dragon. So when playing with the dragon and you draw a volcano or dragon tile there doesn't seem to be a phase 2 because the meeple business now occurs in phase 1.

Could the Z-Man rules have called it 2b instead of 1b? I would say yes. Why hasn't Z-Man fixed it to make it more clear? Probably because the discussions about this have been going on for many years so why fix it now.

This thread did make me put my investigation hat on and I learned that there is an "official" translation of the German rules that has been kept up to date through 2015. And this document is the basis for the wikicarpedia website.

Respuesta 12:
The text clearly states that the dragon runs after you place a meeple (or fairy). So ''1b'' must be a typo, because ''2b'' should be printed – and there would be no confusion. Meepledrone has explained it very well on Carcassonne Central website.

Respuesta 13:
I have been wondering about this.
If the meeple is placed first before the dragon moves why would anyone place a meeple there? Wouldn't the dragon eat the meeple right away as only place to put a meeple is the tile that you have just placed and that is the volcano tile where the dragon begins its movement.

There are 2 tiles at play here.

1. The volcano tile, where one cannot place a meeple, but only move the fairy after placing it. The dragon starts here.
2. The dragon tile, where one can place a meeple or move the fairy. This tile can be placed far away from where the dragon starts or currently is and be out of harms way.

Respuesta 15:
First of all, this all is determined by your personal interpretation of what is currently printed in the rules that come with the expansion. Yes, the original rules from 2005 clearly say you can place the tile and place a meeple or move the fairy, and there are also interpretations that say you can every score any completed features before the dragon moves. The only issue with this is that the strategy of the movement of the Fairy by all of the other players for all of the other turn becomes relatively useless because the only person who is in full control of where the Fairy is when the Dragon starts moving is the player who draws the Dragon tile.

Yes, in the 2022 printed rules it does say that you can’t place a meeple on the volcano, then says that you can place a meeple on the Dragon tile. Then … the dragon moves! The confusion comes from the fact that the English printed rules declare the dragon moves as step 1b and the three languages that come with the Nordic version of the expansion say it is step 1a, and that totally contradicts the concept of WHEN you can place the meeple. The Order of Play on WikiCarPedia makes 1a the step where you decide if you want to play your Abbot or a Halfling or draw a tile, then step 1b is where you draw a tile and reveal it to everyone, and finally step 1c is where you actually place the tile. Then you get to phase 2 of your turn where you CAN place a meeple on that tile.

A strict interpretation of the 2022 printed rules say that the Dragon moves before you even place the Dragon tile on the board in at least English, Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish!

Yes, this may very well be a misprint in all languages, but it does bring back the Logical Strategy for sacrificing placing a meeple for the ability to move the Fairy.

This is the page that our game night group of four will look at before we decide if we want to play with the rules for A or B.

But an interpretation of ALL of the rules includes that Important block of text on the top of page 3 that states that if a player draws a dragon tile before the volcano has been placed, the dragon tile is set aside and a new tile is drawn.

I totally agree with that statement! That is why I created the two part suggestion for our weekly game night group. This Sunday, before we start playing, we can read what I created, make any changes we all agree should be made to either option, then create a house rule for our group. My personal thoughts are that the group will decide to play one game with option A and one game with option B each night!

Each game will probably include River I and River II to start off, then the tiles for Basic Game 72, Inns and Cathedrals 18, Traders and Builders 24, and Princess and Dragon 30. 144 tiles after the River will probably take 2 to 3 hours per game!

Dragon Rules

Respuesta 22:
I'd just been thinking about this again, and have come back pretty strongly on the side of Dragon movement being 1b. As far as I can tell, the Hans in Glück rules are these, which also use the "1b" notation.

The way I interpret these rules (similar in German and English):

Quote:
The Volcano (6 tiles): Volcano tiles are placed exactly like those in
the base game, except you may not place a meeple on a Volcano
tile. You may, however, move the fairy after placing a Volcano tile
(see page 5). Place the dragon on the newly placed Volcano
tile. Then it is the next player's turn.

The Dragon (12 tiles): Dragon tiles are placed exactly like those
in the base game. Unlike Volcano tiles, you are allowed to place a
meeple on a Dragon tile. Then... the dragon moves!
Volcano
* Placed normally (Step 1)
* But you can't play a meeple on them (Step 2)
* You can move the fairy (Step 2)
* Then it's the next player's turn (Step 3+)

Dragon
* Placed normally (Step 1)
* You can place a meeple on them (Step 2)
* But, when you place these tiles the dragon moves (Step 1b, immediately below)

The German HiG rules are

Quote:
Der Vulkan (6 Plättchen): Sobald du ein Plättchen mit einem
Vulkan ziehst, legst du es wie gewohnt an, darfst aber keinen
Meeple darauf setzen. Du darfst allerdings die Fee versetzen
(siehe S. 5). Dann nimmst du den Drachen von seinem momentanen Standort (anfangs vom Spielfeldrand) und setzt ihn direkt
auf dieses Plättchen. Dann ist der nächste Spieler an der Reihe.

Der Drache (12 Plättchen): Sobald du ein Plättchen mit einem
Drachen ziehst, legst du es wie gewohnt an und darfst einen
Meeple darauf setzen. Dann wird das Spiel kurz unterbrochen:
Der Drache zieht!
These both use the word "dann", which although is usually translated as "when", can have a meaning of "in that case" or "in this case". I believe that's the meaning intended for the Dragon tiles, especially since the Dragon movement is listed as Step 1b.

I think the case for having Dragon movement as Step 2b is based on this phrase:

Quote:
Unlike Volcano tiles, you are allowed to place a
meeple on a Dragon tile. Then... the dragon moves!
meaning that "...the dragon moves!" is to take place immediately after "place a meeple on a Dragon tile". However, most folks don't take the order so literally for the volcano rules that immediately precede this - those rules state:

Quote:
Place the dragon on the newly placed Volcano tile. Then it is the next player's turn.
If for instance you place a Volcano tile that completes a city, I think you'd still handle scoring as usual. Interpreting this in the same way as the "2b" dragon rules would suggest that you should skip the scoring phase!

So for those reasons:

* HiG rules using Step 1b for Dragon movement
* "Dann" potentially meaning "in this case"
* The rules for Volcano tiles referring to other turn phases (Step 1, Step 2, and turn end)

I've come back to thinking the intention all-around seems to be that Dragon movement is in Step 1b, before meeple placement or fairy movement!

Issue is, that in rules is written:

Unline Volcano tiles, you are allowed to place a meeple on a Dragon tile.
Then... the dragon moves!

Sobald du ein Plättchen mit einemDrachen ziehst, legst du es wie gewohnt an und darfst einen Meeple darauf setzen.
Dann wird das Spiel kurz unterbrochen: Der Drache zieht!

This is citation from English and German rules C2 rules.

So texting of rules is clear. Placement of meeple is before Move of Dragon, so numbering 1b is typo.

Anyway, checked C1 rules from 2005, which is de facto the same.
When ever a player draws a tile showing a dragon figure, he places it as he would normally place a tile, and may also place a follower on the tile as he normally could. Then, the game is briefly interrupted while the Dragon moves!
Sobald eine Karte mit einem Drachen aufgedeckt wird, legt der Spieler sie wie gewohnt an und darf einen Gefolgsmann darauf setzen. Dann wird das Spiel kurz unterbrochen - der Drache zieht!

Yes I know, sometimes it will be better for others, that placed Fairy will not move from their positions before Dragon moves, but you need also consider, that player which placed a dragon tile, he needs to choose option - place that tile somewhere where he don't need to place his meeple when he needs to protect any of his meeple by fairy. So this gives small advantage to other players.

Respuesta 24:
Another aspect of meeple/fairy first vs. Dragon first is that it affects scoring. If meeple first:
1. Place tile. Tile completes town.
2. Place meeple on town.
2b. Dragon moves and eats meeple.
3. Player gets zero points for completed town.
If dragon first, then the meeple can be placed safely and scored.



Tema 49: Or move
Pregunta:
I recently made a post on CarcassonneCentral about the Princess and Dragon expansion. I don’t want this thread to talk about the entire expansion, but let me set the stage for what I do want to talk about.

There is a lot of strategy during the game on placing a Volcano, and the Dragon, away from your features and next to your opponent’s features. Then part of the strategy moves to moving the Fairy around the board to get points and/or protect your features from the Dragon. The exact words for moving the Fairy are:

On any turn in which you do not place (or move) a meeple, you may assign the fairy to one of your meeples by placing the fairy directly next to it.

So, the real question is: What does a player have to give up to gain the right to move the Fairy?

Not placing a meeple is easy to define, but what does “or move” mean?

There is general consensus that placing the Dragon tile, then not placing a meeple on it, then returning your Abbot back to your stack to score some points is moving your abbot, so you can’t move the Fairy. From there it gets a little confusing!

Being able to place a Dragon tile, then moving the Fairy from protecting one of your opponent’s meeples to protecting one of your meeples is a major strategic issue, so, what exactly are the rules that allow you and/or stop you from doing just that? What exactly does “or move” mean?

"Moving the Wood" is an unofficial phase of Carcassonne. It just means that on your turn, move the wood whether it is from your supply or from the board. Moving the Fairy IS moving the wood, so you cannot move any other wood.

The rule you quote above about placing or moving wood is being a little pedantic.

Rules don't say anything about the need to place a meeple to change a ferry direction, you only need to extend the road with it. Don't forget to read the rules Marco posted

How good - IMO, fiddly. Though it provides some tactical decisions, especially in conjunction with inns

Respuesta 3:
you can move a ferry if you extended the road connected with it, whether there are meeples on that street or not is irrelevant to whether you can move the ferry.



Tema 51: traders and builders
Pregunta:
can 2 different players builders be on the same road/city?

Respuesta 1:
Yes but remember you can only claim unclaimed territory.
So this could only happen if 2 separate roads/cities/fields are merged together with a tiles while both where already claimed by separate players.

Respuesta 2:
and both can use the special builder rule to play twice afterwards on the same road then

Respuesta 3:
sebas labu
@bloodking23
and both can use the special builder rule to play twice afterwards on the same road then
Yes, if a player extends a feature (road or city) in which their own builder is already present they take a second turn.
(This happens just the once - even if the player uses their second turn to extend the same feature.)

Respuesta 4:
I would also add that it applies to the pigs.

Basically, it's like this:
1. Player 1 claims something (road, city or field)
2. Player 2 claims the same feature as P1
3. Feature 1 and feature 2 are merged into one

At any point (separate features 1 or 2 or conjoined feature) any player may add "special" followers that are not counted as meeples (builder and pig). It doesn't even have to be separate features for this to work

In other words, if there is a city/road/field that already has meeples of at least two different players, any of that players may:
1. Add its own builder/pig at any time the city/road/field is extended
2. Benefit from the builder when city/road is extended and get a second tile

Respuesta 5:

@bloodking23

You may already know this, but just in case: you only get to play an extra tile when you extend the city/road your builder is on. If someone else extends it, you don't.

Tema 52: rules about river
Pregunta:
If i play a game with the river do I not use the first basic game tile (the one with a darker backside) ?

Our house-rule is that the next player in turn after the river is completed gets to place that tile.

Correct, you don't. Per the current Z-Man Supplementary Rules:

Quote:
The River is comprised of 12 River tiles with a dark back that replace the start tile.
When playing with The River, return the start tile to the box.

Respuesta 3:
What they said.

But we use a bag to draw tiles from, so when using the river we just add the start tile in to the bag with the others, where its different back won't be an issue. (We sometimes use a smaller bag for the river tiles.)

Respuesta 4:
I add the tile to the bag to draw too. Since the base game has 71 tiles, adding this back in makes it a nice 72, which means that the player who goes last in our 2 player game will place the last tile (unless we're playing with the builder, then that gets thrown out the window).

Respuesta 5:
by the rules no, but you can if you want. There are a couple of mini expansions that we almost always use and we often add a bigger expansion as well, so we don't add the tile if using the river because we've got plenty of tiles.



Tema 53: Can i do this?
Pregunta:
Hi.

if I have a meeple on an uncompleted street. On my turn, i complete the street with a new tile so i take the point and remove the already present meeple. Can I also add a new meeple on the newly placed tile?

ty

Respuesta 1:
The rules state the following order of play:
1. Play a tile
2. Place a worker
3. Score completed tiles.

So following this order, no you can't. But we house rule that you can. So in the end it is up to you I guess

Respuesta 2:
Turn order goes like this:

1) Place tile
2) Place meeple
3) Score completed features and remove meeples from those features

So if you have a meeple available in your situation above, then yes, you can place one on the tile, and then score and remove the meeple that's already there. If you don't already have a meeple available, than you cannot do what you wanted.

Respuesta 3:
If you have a meeple in hand, you can, but you have to do it in the right order.

1. Play your tile and complete your street.
2. Add a meeple to a feature on the new tile.
3. Score and take back the meeple on the street.

You cannot score the street, then place that meeple on the new tile. If you don't have one in hand, you can't do what you want.

Edit: Wow, in the time it took for me to write this, DoomTurtle posted almost the same thing.

For reference, contemporary Z-Man rules are correct but somewhat less visible in their placement ahead of the descriptions of the 3 actions.

Starting with the first player, the current player does the
following actions in the order listed below, . . .

Older rules from Rio Grande are more emphatic with the use of BOLD text.

On a player's turn, he executes the
following actions in the order shown:
* The player must draw and place a new land tile.
* The player may deploy one of his followers from his supply to the land tile he just placed.
* If, by placing the land tile, cloisters, roads, and/or cities are completed, they are now scored.

@leonidas98

This is an important point: you can never place a meeple on any feature that already has a meeple on it, of any player, including yourself.

You can place a meeple on a feature that might in future connect to a feature with another meeple. I've had some long battles over control of a large city.

You can also (cribbing from Schoolmarm):
1. Play your tile and complete a city or street with no meeple on it.
2. Add a meeple to the city or street you just completed on the tile you just placed.
3. Score the city or street, and take back the meeple.

This is why it's a bad idea to play your last meeple, unless you're going to pick it right up again.



Tema 54: Town scoring
Pregunta:
Hi there, just a quick question regarding scoring the tile I have marked with red arrows, is it 2 points or 4 points as it's two different sections of a walled town?

Respuesta 1:
Each tile is only counted once per city. Here the segments on that tile belong to the same city, and the tile counts as 2 points for that city.

Respuesta 2:
Thank you.

Respuesta 3:
Contemporary Z-Man rules are properly written as points per tile, but give no elaboration or emphasis.

Each tile in the completed city is worth 2 points.


Older Rio Grande Games rules have more explanation (here with my highlight),

The player who has a knight in a completed city
scores two points for each tile in the city (count
the tiles, not the segments).

I know this wasn’t asked but this rule about counting tiles instead of segments is not universal across all Carcassonne games.

I am not familiar with H&G, but I find this in contemporary rules from current publisher Z-Man Games.

From page 5, section titled 3. Score completed features. Bold below as printed, my highlight.

Older Rio Grande Games rules do indeed refer to "segments".

Page 1 illustrates a single tile with 2 specifically identified segments, "2 separate forest segments".

Also, page 4, "A player with the only gatherer in a completed forest scores 2 points for each forest
segment."

The use of "only" in that quote bothers me, but further below that, "If a player has more tribe members, he scores the points alone. If several players tie with the most tribe members in the area, they each score the full points for the area"

Respuesta 8:
Thanks for the references. Yes, I was referring to the Rio Grande version which is the one I have. Didn’t realize the newer edition changed that rule. Very subtle difference.

Personally, I like counting the tiles instead of segments for scoring as it seems less prone to error when determining points.



Tema 55: Score a feature immediately after finishing it?
Pregunta:
We played our first game today and one issue came up: if I lay down a tile which immediately finishes a feature without a meeple, can I place a meeple and immediately score it? E.g. we had many small 2-part cities where no meeple was when finishing them with the second tile…

Yes.

I don't know what version you have, and there is a lot of variance between them, but the rules should give the order of play:

1. Place a tile.
2. Place a meeple (if you can and want to).
3. Score any completed features.
4. Remove meeples from completed features (in my rules, this step is only explained after the rules for scoring, rather than being explicitly a separate step).

So you can place a meeple before scoring, which means you can score for that meeple immediately.

Respuesta 2:
I own the new 20th Anniversary Edition. Thanks mate!

Respuesta 3:
This is a fairly common question, and there's one important wrinkle. You must have a meeple available to do this.

Suppose you place a tile that completes (ends) a road that you have claimed, and the tile also completes a city. You have no meeples in hand. You cannot score the city in this case, even though you would eventually get a meeple by scoring the road. The order is steps is very important.

1. Place a tile. This would be placing the combination road / city tile in my example above
2. Place a meeple. At this point you have not yet scored the road, so you cannot pick up your road-claiming meeple and use it to score the city
3. Score completed features Now you pick up the road meeple and score the points. But we are beyond the Place a Meeple step so you cannot now claim the completed city

Hopefully that makes sense and does not confuse the issue further. We call the ability to play and immediately score a "bounce meeple" because you play one from your supply and immediately return it to your supply.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks so much for clarifying this further!



Tema 56: The Art of the Un-Trap
Pregunta:
The first subject discussed in Chapter 8 (advanced features) in The Book of Carcassonne is The Art of the Trap, which is closely followed by the discussion on digging holes!

Our neighborhood group of four started playing in June of 2021. Two of us are well into the art of the trap which is causing the other two to start talking about other games. Carcassonne does offer the Abbey and Mayor expansion that completely eliminates the traps, and also Halflings which basically cuts the traps in half, and of course the Bridges that do provide a little help in breaking out of a trap: but we are still looking for other ways for our more gentle players to un-trap themselves.

So, here is what we are thinking!

We wanted to start using Bridges a few months ago, and since Z-Man Games has basically stopped producing Carcassonne Expansions for the US market, we had to create the bridges for ourselves. So, we got a piece of three eighth inch square oak trim from Lowes and cut it into 1 ¾ inch strips to use as the Fake Bridges.

Then, we recently read a post by kothmann where he talked about the Gates and Walls that he created as part of his personal Old City Expansion. Basically, when a city tile, with a pennant, exists next to an empty space, you can place a Wall on the edge of the city and then place a field tile next to it, or, you can place a Gate on the edge of the city and then place a road tile next to it.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/19u_XBVNw7EbzUPn_TstHHnjQyZc...

The ability to use Gates and/or Walls and/or Bridges to modify the four sides of the trap makes the probability of filling the hole far more possible.

Our basic game usually includes 125 tiles: 71 basic game tiles, 12 river tiles, 18 Inns and Cathedrals tiles, and 24 Trader and Builder tiles . . . plus 4 of our fake wooden bridges for each player, which we will now probably rename as Tile Modifiers, which can be used as either Bridges, Gates, or Walls as the game progresses. We will not restrict the use of Gates and Walls to only cities with pennants, but we will restrict them to only city tiles that touch four sided holes, like the Abbey tile restriction.

Here is the page on our personal Carcassonne website that talks about this personal Expansion in more detail:

http://www.papageek.com/car/GatesWalls.htm

Your opinions would be greatly appreciated. Again, our target is to help less aggressive players ease into the Art of the Trap with an easier way out of the traps as they get used to making them!

Respuesta 1:
Excellent suggestion! Limiting it to the wild tile, “must be an empty hole,” rules makes sure it is only used in direst need. It also strengthens the visual appeal of the final board by filling in holes while still making it visually consistent.

For the reluctant competitive players, it might sweeten the pot for those that love making traps if leftover bridges netted a player points at the end of the game. Like the stations in Ticket To Ride: Europe.

If you have the original bridges, turn them upside down to act as walls. You can add a little gate with sharpie, or just accept it as a road end without explicit gate. Either would be OK with my group as the aesthetic pleasure of a completely tiled map is worth much more than 100% consistency with those small details.

Respuesta 2:
Many thanks Daniel, your suggestion is excellent and it will be suggested to our group at tonight’s game night. Your exact suggestion is now quoted on our Carcassonne website with the following adaptation:

Ticket To Ride is not a Carcassonne expansion, but the concept that each unused Modifier would be worth 5 extra points during the end of game scoring, similar to the scoring rules for Goods Tokens, does have merit!

Respuesta 7:
I've played a lot* of BGA Carcassonne. Most of it without Inns and Cathedrals but there does seem to be a glitch with the Inn scoring.

I do understand that the correct scoring is that only the roads adjacent to an Inn should be affected by the score increase. So, specifically on the T-junction tile(s), where the Inn is above the horizontal bar of the T the road forming the upright of the T should be the only one that is not affected by the score multiplier. However it is my experience that it is one of the halves of the horizontal bar that is not affected.

I've reported this as a bug as have others. But now that people have asserted that BGA is getting it right I feel I should check that the behaviour is (still?) as I recall it. I'll come back and post again.

* Over 1000 games is a lot right?

Tema 59: Farmers!
Pregunta:
I am trying to explain the farmer rules, but I can never do the rule justice until the end of the game. Does anyone have a way to explain farmers that have helped them?

Respuesta 1:
"A Farmer stays on a Field until the end of the game. At the end of the game, a Farmer scores 3 points for each completed City that touches the Field."

That's all I say to people and a good portion understand it. I also usually demonstrate by showing an example with the tiles and a Meeple. I never really understood the confusion people have with the Farmer rules. Usually by the second game people get it. When playing with a bunch of noobs, I still play with Farmer but I don't push for them hard—usually just claim something middling somewhere in the middle of the game. Sometimes the other players catch on, other times they don't. Either way, they all figure out how they're scored by the second game. Ignoring Farmers the first game just delays people actually enjoying the full game.

Respuesta 2:
Also don't forget to mention that when one intends to place a farmer, they must scope the whole field to ensure it doesn't belong to another existing placed farmer from a previous turn. Just like roads and Castles.

Respuesta 3:
It is also worthwhile pointing out it is a high risk - high reward strategy.
Using a meeple as a farmer takes it out of the game until the end. With meeples as tight as they are, that can be problematic. But Farmers can pay off very big.

Respuesta 4:
And the pigs, don't forget the pigs

Respuesta 5:
Farmers are essential to understand. Let's face it, Carcassonne is not a complicated game and Farmers are not a complicated rule. A player who places a farmer or two properly while others can't be bothered, the farmer player will likely win the game. Once a few cities have been completed, all players need to start considering where to lay their first farmer down. I am only speaking for base game with rivers add-on. Things may change when you start adding other expansions.

Respuesta 6:
One extremely important thing to mention about farmers is that they can also be placed near the end of the game! When there are only a few tiles left, maybe you will only get another 3 or 4 turns, if you can place a farmer on a tiny farm that only touched 2 or 3 closed cities, that farmer will be worth 6 or 9 points at the end of the game!

Respuesta 7:
And, EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, don't even think about stealing your wifes farm. Just get your own farm.

Respuesta 8:
A farm is a single feature which can be built and owned, just like a city, road, or cloister. It scores, at the end of the game, 3 points for any completed city it touches for the player with the most farmers in the field.

NOTE: If the rules in your game show "4 points per city" you have a very old set of rules which caused lots of problems in understanding farms, and need to be thrown out.



Tema 60: Does Player 1 go last?
Pregunta:
If you have a 2 player game, does this mean player 1 goes first and last? And if so, doesn't this seem like a big imbalance?

Respuesta 1:
That's correct. I've played in tournament settings before where a tile was set aside to give both players an equal number of turns. (In fact, since 71 is prime, there's no player count for which players will get an even number of turns without a similar adjustment.)

I would say that in a large number of games played I've never felt bothered by it. But if you do regard it as a problem the 'fix' above is so small it should barely affect anything else about the game.

@Grape Ape
I believe the base game comes with 72 tiles. The starting tile is the first players tile to play.
Nope, the starting tile starts in play, no-one plays it.

I usually just toss aside a tile so that each player has an even number of turns. But it's pretty minor, so I wouldn't worry too much either way.

Respuesta 4:
It's 36 against 35. 1/35 is less than 3% - a random error you can live with, it's not a huge imbalance. The more tiles you have - the less of a diference 1 tile makes. Also, by the end of the game, the probability of the last tile to be THE tile that the first player needs is abysmally minor.
And never forget that if you play a game with a common knowledge of the tiles played, it allows for some calculations whether you will draw the tile you need, or not. Tossing out random tile breaks that mechanic.
If I played with that rule, the discarded tile would be an open information for all players.

But, it's your game, you play it however you want.

Respuesta 5:
Instead of tossing it, play it as another starting tile next the real starting tile? Kind of like the river expansion, but no meeple can be played to it. It's location would just need to be agreed to by both players or it's discarded....

With two expansions in my set, this is a real minor problem and hasn't made a difference in who the winner may have been.

Respuesta 9:
Which feature do they play on? The city?

I'm surprised because unless you're playing with a large enough number of players that players are constrained more by number of turns than number of meeples, playing on a one-tile feature is often committing a meeple for very little gain. (Though maybe the gain is a little larger right at the beginning of the game, when there aren't many other similar unclaimed features lying around)



Tema 61: Arabic Language Rules?
Pregunta:
Hi All,

I've been googling like crazy but haven't found rules in Arabic yet. We have a new friend that just moved here and I'd love to introduce them to a couple games, but sharing some rules in Arabic with them in advance might be helpful.

Any leads on pdfs to the rules in Arabic?

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
I couldn't find a scan of it online, but it looks like there as an official Arabic/English rulebook in the edition published by Super Heated Neurons; it's not out of the realms of possibility that they'd send you an electronic copy of it if you contacted them? Might be worth a try, anyway.



Tema 62: Carcassonne - Is this a town at the start/end of a road?
Pregunta:
Hi. Just wondering if this tile completes a road and starts a new road? Or is it just a small graphic to enhance the image?
Other villages and towns have a dusty town centre, but this doesn't.
It is one of the tiles from the 'River' expansion.
Thanks in advance.

Respuesta 1:
It’s just a graphic- the tile is showing a continuous strip of road with no start/end

Respuesta 2:
Initially we used to play it as a town, but then we saw that in the Carcassonne application it's a road... So now we play it as a road. So depending on who are you playing with it's one of the typical tiles that's better to agree on how to play it before you start...

Respuesta 3:
It's only a small village/settlement on the road, not a city. And only cities start/finish roads.

Respuesta 4:
You can see some examples in Inns & Cathedrals that confirm that the road is not interrputed.

Tema 63: A bazaar auction with builders
Pregunta:
Wikicarpedia says that, after an auction, starting clockwise each player plays their purchased tile as in a normal turn. The footnote says, that a purchased bazaar tile will not trigger an auction, but any drawn bazaar tile will trigger an auction.

OK, players are 1 2 3 4 5, player 3 draws a bazaar and the auction starts with players 4 5 1 2 3. Player 1 draws a second builder tile that is a bazaar tile. Then, as I understand it, players 2 3 play their auctioned tiles, then a new bazaar auction starts for the drawn bazaar tile from player 1.

Question 1: Is the order of this second auction the original 4 5 1 2 3, or is it now, 2 3 4 5 1? And what is the order of playing the second set of auctioned tiles?

Question 2: What happens after the first auction, or any auction, if two players draw a builder tile which are both bazaar tiles? Are there now two extra auctions? And what is the order of play of the subsequent auctioned tiles? And who is the first player after all of the auctions are over?

Respuesta 1:
A purchased bazaar tile will not start another auction. So if a player gets a bazaar tile from an auction (which they are not drawing, they are purchasing), they simply place it like a normal tile and an auction is not held. In your two questions, none of those auctions would happen.

When an auction starts, 1 tile per player is flipped over. These are not considered drawn tiles, they are purchased in the auction and will not trigger another auction.

You've ignored the bit about the Builder (from Traders & Builders ). If you add a tile purchased through auction onto a feature with the Builder follower, does the Builder trigger and grant an extra tile draw? If it does, what happens if the subsequently drawn tile has a bazaar on it?

Where does it say that last part? Is it just at the beginning, where it explains what the bazaars do?

I think the intention of the rules is that (unless it says differently somewhere) no new auction can be started by any of the tiles that are auctioned off. I'd guess they just never thought about this edge case where one of them causes a builder to activate. So I wouldn't start a new auction in this case.

Without knowing if any official rulings exist, I would be tempted to ignore any Builder interaction completely. The auction is breaking the flow of the game enough, no need to add extra out-of-turn turns to the mess.

Respuesta 5:
I’m getting my information from the WikiCarPedia page for Bridges, Castles and Bazaars. At the end of the “4. Host a bazaar auction” section, the next to the last section say:

No chain reaction: If a bazaar tile auctions another bazaar tile, no auction takes place when the second bazaar tile is placed. Only after all auctioned tiles have been placed, a new bazaar auction can take place. [28]

Footnote 28 says: Note that a purchased bazaar tile will not trigger an auction, but any drawn bazaar tile will trigger an auction. Nonetheless, as discussed in the Q&A clarification in the Other expansions section, the auction may not happen immediately if the drawing of the tile occurred during a builder-turn during a bazaar round.

Within the Q&A clarification it says: If you placed your auctioned tile and you can perform a builder-turn, you can choose to place your abbey or draw a new unknown tile. If any player draws a new bazaar tile, it will be ignored until the last player who has an auctioned tile finishes his turn (including his builder-turn, if possible). Any pending delayed bazaars will take place now in turn. Once the bazaar rounds are finished, you perform your builder-turn.

OK, yes our group is about to make this very confusing. We are planning for one of our next game nights to include both the Bridges, Castles and Bazaars expansion AND the Traders and Builders expansion. SO, as I read the last two sentences of the Q&A clarification for Bazaar / Exp.2 – Traders and Builders:

Any pending delayed bazaars will take place now in turn. (there can be multiple “bazaars”).

Once the bazaar rounds are finished, you perform your builder-turn. (there can be multiple “rounds”).

The initial Q&A is talking about the player who is starting the entire Bazaar Auction. If that player draws a Bazaar tile that allow them to also take a second builder tile; they finish the Bazaar first, then take their builder tile! But then the Answer also include the concept that during the initial auction, each of the auctioned tiles might also allow each of the initial players to place their tile on features in which they have builders where they can also draw second round tiles!

The only thing that is limiting the complexity of this question is that there are only 8 bazaar tiles in the pile!

Respuesta 6:
Any bazaars on tiles placed during a bazaar round are now totally ignored, so the complexity created by delayed bazaars is now gone.

https://wikicarpedia.com/index.php/Bridges,_Castles_and_Baza...

Respuesta 7:
I can agree with all but the last line of new answer!

The purpose of placing your builder on a feature that you want to complete before anyone else can complete it for you, or somehow block your completion, is the ability to draw a second tile and place it immediately.

Waiting for the entire bazaar to be completed completely goes against what the builder is for.

I draw a bazaar tile which I place on my builder’s feature. I must then allow up to 6 players with up to 6 builder second turns to place up to 12 tiles before I can take my builder second turn!

My personal opinion on this would be that the first four steps should now be five steps:
Draw bazaar and perform first part of your double turn.
Draw the tiles (still face-down)
( Start ignoring any new bazaars )
Perform your builder-turn (second part of your double turn)
Turn tiles face-up and perform the auction
Now each player can play their auctioned tile and builder second turn if applicable
. . .
( Stop ignoring any new bazaars )



Tema 64: Bridges and Farm Land

Just to clarify, because it's not 100% obvious what you meant and what was answered. (because some could interpret it as "bridge connects fields from different sides")

From your example, for the red tile:
Left field of the red tile connects to two fields on the left, separated by the road, and makes it to be one big field on the left (since the bridge "starts" from the edge of the tile)
Right field of the red tile is a separate field, not divided by the bridge in any way, as per rules.
As of placing red tile, its left field (connected to the big one on the left) and its right field (isolated from other tiles) are two SEPARATE fields

In terms of how this bridge would work, it acts exactly as this tile:

i.e. fields on each side of the city aren't divided by the road, and those fields are two separate entities until you connect them somehow

It is pretty objective. Sorry if you are having trouble parsing the entire post. From the first paragraph of the OP:

Sandy Bittman
@PapaGeek2
I own a farm with a number of cities on it ... I want to extend my farm beyond a road that is under construction next to it.

Before placing the red-outlined tile, the OP stated they already owned the farm and wanted to continue the field on both sides of the road. This is before the new tile is placed and before the bridge is placed. There is only one condition showing with a road separating two fields. No one is talking about the field on the lower right (or the one on the upper right that hasn't even been placed yet).

The new tile is placed, which is only legal with the addition of a bridge. The two fields (as pointed out in the opening statement) separated by the existing road (as pointed out in the opening statement) are now connected.

Quote:
When I place my bridge on the tile I just placed with farm land on both sides, the existing road is properly continued across the new tile AND the farmland on both sides of that road are now connected as a single farm.
Bridges connect roads, not fields. No one claimed it would connect fields separated by a city.

Understanding the OP's original statement and intent with his question, my response was "the field continues under the bridge" (not across it as if the fields magically connect over the city). You are the first to suggest that the two fields are the one on the new tile. No one else.

It's all there in objective black and white.

Respuesta 9:
Brian, you are wrong, Chris was not "the first" nor "the only" one to suggest that, there is Boris. Frankly I doubted about that for a second the first time I saw the post, i had to read it twice, so I can consider Boris comment justified and useful. I find your correction irrelevant, the main post didn't need any help or defense, there was no accusation or crime, only a friendly clarification add.



Tema 65: Partial Expansions
Pregunta:
We are a small group of 4 players who all purchased the Bix Box 2017 version of the game a few months ago. The first thing that we do at the beginning of each game is make a group decision on what expansions are we going to include in the next game. What we love most about the game is that it is different every time we sit down to play it!

As we got into larger games adding 24 Trader tiles and 18 Inns tiles, the farms started getting even more interesting and now we are adding just the Barns from the Abbey and the Mayor expansion and our next step will be adding just the Bridges from the Bridges, Castles and Bazaars expansion.

How does everyone else feel about adding partial expansions? Are there any official rules that we should follow, or just wing it?

One reason for not adding all of each expansion is that, sometimes, the backs of the tiles from separately purchased expansion are just slightly a different shade of grey. Does anyone have a good way around this problem?

You can put all of the tiles into a bag and draw from there.

Otherwise I don't think there's really any issue with adding only parts of an expansion. I've always seen each expansion as a collection of mini-expansions anyway. When we play, I might use Abbeys but no Mayors or even new tiles. I like the Bridges but dislike the Bazaars, etc.

Respuesta 2:
It's your game. You can tailor it the way you see fit
You can add any tiles (even doubles) and can remove any. The same applies to meeples

Respuesta 3:
At least one expansion ( ) is a compilation of previously-released mini-expansions anyway, so I think that provides ample cover for treating everything as a set to mix-and-match from.

Respuesta 4:
You can also just add all tiles and ignore the symbols for expansions that you don't want to use. For example, if you have the tower tiles mixed in, just ignore the tower icon and use the tile for everything else.

You can use the Tower (if you have it) or a bag to draw blindly. But I don't think the off gray tile backs gives away that much information. Just have people grab off a stack and not look too closely.

Respuesta 5:
The key is everyone's agreement at the beginning and understanding how the expansions interact with one another. We pick and choose all the time.

Respuesta 6:
However, be careful with the bag as they can damage the tiles very quickly if it's not a big enough bag, I'd say use the Tower from Expansion 4 to avoid the slight difference of grey. Or you could just tell everyone to not look closely at the stack/pile.

Respuesta 7:
One of the great joys of Carcassonne is how modular it is. Playing with partial expansions is totally your prerogative.

Unfortunately, many of the expansions do have slight colour problems (which is well documented on the forums here). Whilst a keen-eyed player will notice they are clearly picking something up from an expansion they have no idea what that tile contains, so it's a minor issue (at least when we play, and especially if you're combining several expansions).

More often than not, we play for the final aesthetic, so it really is about how much (or little) of any given expansion takes your fancy on a given day.

Respuesta 8:
Our group only started playing Carcassonne in June with the Big Box Version, but we have already added Abbey and the Mayor plus Bridges, Castles and Bazaars, so we have already experienced the slight color problem with the backs of the tiles.

Our solution was to stop taking each tile from a single spread out array of inverted tiles. We start each game with that pile, then randomly make 4 equal size stacks of tiles. We place a stack next to each player, then on your turn: You pick up a portion of your stack and drop the bottom tile on the table. That way you are still selecting a random tile from the middle of your stack, but you can’t see the back of the tile before you select it. To make it more fun, you don’t have to take a middle tile from your own stack, you can take a middle tile from the player that you are saying has “better tiles”, who in turn can take a middle tile from you!

As the game continues, and we all have about 4 or 5 tiles left, at some point we just combined all the stacks into a single stack and randomly take middle of stack tiles!

2. Placing a meeple OR your abbot
When placing a tile with a monastery or a garden, you may place either a meeple or your abbot.
The meeple is placed as usual whereas the abbot must be placed on the monastery or garden you’ve just placed.



Tema 67: Mayor and Builder
Pregunta:
Not sure of the rule in this situation! I’m trying to steal a large city. I place a city tile close to it and place my mayor on that tile. On my next turn I am able to extend my new city closer to the large city that I want, but no coats of arms yet in my new city, so the mayor has the value of zero meeples!

My question is: can I place my builder on the tile I just placed? The rule says, “you must already have one normal meeple on the feature”. This includes standard meeples and large meeples, does it include a mayor with zero coats of arms?

Respuesta 1:
Yes, the mayor is a “normal” meeple for the purposes of the builder. Even if he currently has a strength of zero.

The only ones that don’t count as normal meeples are those that aren’t placed in the normal fashion, like the builder itself. I can’t think of any off the top of my head that could already be on the feature in this case unless they were ones that don’t belong to any player, like the mage and witch. But there might well be some this would apply to in the billions of expansions out there!

You can certainly do that, but the official rules are that it is removed permanently.

Losing one tile won't make an impact. If you haven't already done the math, there are only 71 playable tiles in the base game anyway (since the starting tile belongs to no one). That is not divisible by any of the player counts so not everyone has equal turns anyway. "Missing" one more isn't going to hurt anything.

I find that older rules from Rio Grande are often more informative than contemporary Z-Man.

Examples:

First a player must draw a land tile from one of the face-down stacks. He looks at it, shows it to his fellow players
(so they can advise him on the "best" placement of the tile), . . .


In the rare circumstance where a drawn tile has no legal
placement (and all players agree), the player discards the tile
from the game (into the box) and draws another tile to place.



Tema 69: Is this order of play legal?

Red trying to steal a city from yellow. Is this order of play allowed? If so, can the same order of play be done in trying to steal a highway?

Respuesta 1:
It is illegal.
Furthermore, even the beginning setup (first picture) is illegal.
Yellow shouldn't have the second meeple there.
You can't put a meeple in a city which is already occupied by any other meeple, even your own.

Respuesta 2:
No, in fact, a rule was broken before the first picture. You cannot add a meeple to an occupied city, so yellow can't have 2 in that 2-square city.

Respuesta 3:
No. Workers must be placed on the tile laid, and you cannot place a worker on a feature that already has a worker on it (builder/pig excepted). So in your picture, both 2 and 4 are illegal placements of workers

Respuesta 4:
But, just to be clear the red meeple in the first picture IS legal because that city segment isn't yet connected to yellow's city. However, every subsequent meeple from red is illegal.

Respuesta 5:
Unless your opponent is a politician. They can do illegal stuff and get away with it.

Respuesta 6:
I agree with all the above but there are even more illegal placements than just the meeples.

The tile Red tries to claim in picture 4 isn't possible (beyond the reasons given) because you can't claim any part of a tile previously played.

And the tile placed in picture 4 isn't legal because the road can't touch the field.

I suggest reading the rules again. Maybe for the first time!

Here is a rules quote for reference. Contemporary Z-Man rules try to teach by showing an example of gameplay . Older Rio Grande rules spell it out with direct language shown below (with special emphasis in the parentheticals).

another tile (no matter how far away) that already has a follower (from any player, including himself) on it.

Diagonals aren't connected, so those are two different cities (that's the game's term for it; there's an expansion that uses the term 'castle' for a different thing). At the game's end, each city would score 1 point per tile. Yellow would get 1 point and Red would get 3.

3 points for the red player (1 point for each castle tile with no shields), 1 point for the yellow player.

@RadRed85
is yellow considered to be connected with the other castle pieces?
No

Respuesta 3:
The tile with reds meeple on it is an illegal tile play.

Respuesta 4:
How so?

Respuesta 5:
The roads at the bottom don't match.

Respuesta 6:
It could be the straight road that was placed second.

It could be the straight road that was placed second.
It would have been, since the starting tile is in the upper left.

Respuesta 8:
That still doesn’t make sense.
I’m sure the OP was more concerned about representing the diagonal city situation, but I’m not sure how you can say the straight road is legal even if played second.
The roads still need to connect for it to be legal, correct?

Respuesta 9:
To clarify you are asking about the scoring of cities not castles. Castles do exist in Carcassonne and are distinct.

Yes, considering where the starting tile is, it is more accurate to say the straight road piece is an illegal placement, since that tile must continue the road that is to its right.



Tema 71: New Player Farmer Question
Pregunta:
Hi everyone,

i'm very late to carcassonne haha.. thanks BGA, we've bought the physical game, but been struggling to make sure we're scoring the farmers correctly, so we played a couple of games online to see how the CPU does the scoring, and failing to see how i got all 4 of my blue farmers to actually score here.

I thought the two to the left of the map had been cutoff and it was just going to be a tie with red. Could someone please redraw on the photo below and let me know how they all connect to help us visualize it.

Please and thank you

Respuesta 1:
The farm land goes around the lake and ties the fourth farmer into everything.

Respuesta 2:
Sorry, not going to take the time to draw, but to my view this map has a really huge farm, with 4 blue and 3 red in it.

The two on the left can connect up by following the farm downriver, around the lake, up and over the road around the "+24" label, then stay close to the river up to the top of the map and down the middle/right.

@qphilli
Hi Quincy, thank you so much for taking the time to reply and redraw... because seeing it, is what helps to see exactly why we are having a hard time seeing where it connects. That tile has a little city with a road going to the city, and we though that would block any farmer from continuing on. And that's why we couldn't figure out how the continous green farm land was connected, same to the right of the blue farmer and how there'a s bridge/road going into that castle.

So what roads can get passed through and which ones can't is confusing us thank you so much in the meantime!

Respuesta 5:
The lower place you have marked does not have a road between the village and the city, so it's clear for the farm. The upper spot does have a road, so it's blocked.

Respuesta 6:
Here's a zoom in on that open space between the village and the city. There doesn't seem to be any tile in the base game that puts a road across such a gap.

Thank you Byron and Daniel... that’s the problem with a computer game I guess, We couldn’t see it and didn’t even notice that, thought it was blocking. That makes perfect sense now. Thank you everyone!!!

Respuesta 8:
Check to see if the BGA implementation has a "show farms" feature. On the Switch version, you can enable that option, and the fields will be highlighted with the colors of the player(s) that control it. It should also show what should and doesn't block them.



Tema 72: Maps: what is "the open side of large city"?
Pregunta:
The rules for many maps indicate that we cannot place a map chip "adjacent to an open side of a large city". What is this exactly? The rules for the maps or the rules of the Big Box 6 don't mention this concept (the unofficial rule compendium doesn't either).

I would guess that "an open side of a large city" is a city side of a large city, since otherwise they would have used the usual "adjacent to a large city". Is this your understanding as well?

Respuesta 1:
Hello,

I think when placing the chips on the board you cannot place them directly beside cities they can only be placed diagonally to a city. It would be too easy for players to collect chips that way.

By placing the chips diagonally to a city the active player now has to decide whether to place the tile next to the city and give the following player a chance to pick up the chip or not.

I hope this helps.

Take care,
Douglas Fost

Respuesta 2:
That's how we interpret the rule, a map chit could then be adjacent to a city tile along a green border. However it is quite easy to randomize the chits such that they are not adjacent to any side of the preprinted city tiles if you're worried about imbalanced set up.

Respuesta 3:
Putting chits adjacent to the green border of a large city is indeed allowed (I found this out after my first post): the example for the Iberian Peninsula displays this case. I don't see any other possible interpretation of "open border" of a large city.



Tema 73: Maps: do all players have to start near a starting tile?
Pregunta:
When using maps, do all players have to start near a starting tile?

The rules read:
Quote:
You start your game by placing your first tile next to these tiles.
Do "your game" and "your first tile" refer to each individual player, who would then have to start near a starting tile? Or is the idea that only the very first tile in the game has to start there?

Respuesta 1:
In maps you have more than one starting tile, this means you can follow the already played for a previous player or choose to play next to any other starting position, unlike classic Carcassonne where all start from just one point.

Respuesta 2:
Indeed.

The question is about something else, though: does each player have to play their first tile adjacent to a starting tile?

Respuesta 3:
That's how we've played and it works well for all of the maps.

Respuesta 4:
I think it's just awkward wording that is causing the confusion here. It would make no sense and overly complicate the rules for no benefit to have each player have to play their first tile adjacent to a starting tile. They probably should have just indicated that you need to always place a new tile adjacent to at least one already placed tile (whether or not it's a starting tile is irrelevant).

Respuesta 5:
Eric O. Lebigot
@lebigot
Indeed.

The question is about something else, though: does each player have to play their first tile adjacent to a starting tile?
I did answer you. Players don't have to, the text is just addressing this main difference from the classic game, that players now can layout tiles on any of those starting points (not just the one where the first player did). There should not point of such kind of restriction, specially if then rules doesn't force you to be attached only to your "region" until being connected to others (is this the case?).

Respuesta 6:
Todd Bertrand
@Gunho81

This is a good point. It does point to the interpretation that all players must play their first tile adjacent to a starting time (like sgclouthier and Chango do), though, otherwise why bother with a more complicated wording?

Also, I would add that we must start with 2 starting tiles at least, which allows for up to 8 players starting besides a starting tile—just enough for the maximum number of players (6) in the base game.

Ah, indeed, my bad. I somehow didn't read "or any other starting tile" properly (I skipped "starting"). Sorry.

Respuesta 8:
This extended rules quote for reference purposes (my highlight on the final sentence).

OVERVIEW
There are several start-squares on each map. On each square there is a small town
and they are with a red edging. You should start with at least 2 start-squares. Take
the starting tile (with the darker backside) and one or 2 random tiles and place all
of them on 2 to 3 start-squares. You start your game by placing your first tile next
to these tiles.

Respuesta 9:
Yeah, the highlighted sentence is precisely the ambiguous one quoted in the original post: is "your game" an unusual way of referring to each player, or a way of referring to the game, which should start from a starting tiles (and then subsequent players can play besides a new tile instead of a starting tile)?

It looks like each player should start besides a starting tile.

Respuesta 10:
Eric O. Lebigot
@lebigot
It looks like each player should start besides a starting tile.
I disagree. That requires far too much interpretation from a casually constructed sentence. See also the use of "you" in an earlier sentence,

You should start with at least 2 start-squares.

I can find no reason to infer "you" as meaning "each player" in either case.

I suggest that requiring each player to begin next to a different start tile is far too significant to be left to such imprecise wording. If it was intended to be a requirement then it should have been stated more directly with explicit language.

Respuesta 11:
Hello,

We have always played that the first player has to start off one of the starting tiles(DUH) but after that any player can place a tile off either the start tiles or the previously placed tile.

This hasn't been an issue with any of our games.

Take care,

Tema 74: Silly question
Pregunta:
I can't seem to find an answer to this in the rulebook, it's probably something obvious I'm overlooking but... If you place an end city card on another end city card effectively completing a two tile city, can you on that same turn place a worker on it, complete the city, get the points and have your meeple returned on the same turn? Seems inelegant if so.

Respuesta 1:
Yes: the order is:

1. Place a tile
2. Place a meeple
3. Count newly finished projects

Respuesta 2:
Yep, and the same can be done with a road and monastery....though to complete a monastery immediately is rare.

Respuesta 3:
You can even do that with roads, too. Heck, you can do it with features larger than two tiles that are empty of followers, including cloisters. Drop a cloister into a one-tile hole in the map and voila, nine points and a follower back in your hands in time for afternoon tea.

It's a wise strategy to keep at least one follower in your supply so you can grab yourself two points for a road here, four points for a city there.

Dan Burt

Please consider helping readers now and in the future by making it more informative, such as (your own language) "have your meeple returned on the same turn?"

(easily changed by using the "ellipsis" - 3 dots and the bottom right of your message - and choosing Edit)

Respuesta 9:
The point is to place your meeples and get them back so they can be deployed again. Closing a two tile city nets you 4 VP without tying up a meeple longer term which frequently is the best point return you can get on any given turn particularly if you are playing Carc with single tile draws.

Tema 75: Tiles altered between 2014 and 2017
Pregunta:
I've just been comparing the base game sets of 72 tiles between my 2014 English version, and my German Big Box 6 (2017) edition.

Although 54 of them were relatively easy to match up, the remainder were a bit tricky. After much twisting and squinting, I found that 17 tiles were identical, except for their front image being rotated with respect to the alignment of the "C" on the back - or zero effect on game play.

That leaves just one tile that is different.
My 2017 set includes three tiles that look something like this:

-------
| ) ( |
-------

(ie with a city linking two opposite edges, flanked by two green fields on either side).

One of these three has no shield symbol, and that one is identical to its 2014 counterpart. Another has a shield, and the 2014 edition only differs by being rotated 90° clockwise (so included in the 17 mentioned above).

However, the final one, although not rotated, has added a shield from the 2014 equivalent.

Is this a mistake? An improvement, or correction of a previous mistake? A variant?

And are there any other such differences between tile sets from different editions, either in the base game or expansions?

Thank you for any info.

Respuesta 1:
Steve

Take a look at this reference image in connection with my comment below it - https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5892488/carcassonne

Both versions should contain 1 tile without a 'shield' and 2 with a 'shield'. (See row 3, columns 2 and 3 in that reference image.) There has been no change in the base game tile distribution at any time since Carcassonne was first released (with different artwork but still with the same distribution) in 2000/2001.

If I've understood correctly, it sounds as though it is your 2014 edition that doesn't conform to the standard distribution.

On tile backs my understanding is that there isn't necessarily consistency in the rotation of the Carcassonne "C" on the back of each tile.

Respuesta 2:
On tile backs. My intuition is that, because tiles are printed on rectangular sheets and can hence be presented in one of two ways, differences in backs will be 180 degrees only?

Respuesta 3:
My set has the same difference as I mentioned in this Solo Challenge thread from October. I have two of those tiles without shields and one with. It seems to be standard with the 2014 set. I don't know if it intentional or simply an error.

Respuesta 4:
came here to mention that I have the 2014 Brazilian Devir edition with the same issue.

Tema 76: A clarification of some of the rules?
Pregunta:
Tried fast googling and even watched a video explaining the rules, but still got some questions regarding a few things.

1)Tile placements, when placing a tile at least one side must align with an already placed tile, but what if the tile that is being placed has, for example, a road, which, when placed, would lead into a wall ( not a road ) or into the middle of a city? Can i still place it or I must make sure that all sides of a tile match the tiles it would be adjacent to?
2) How many meeples can I placed in a single city or road? Can I just keep placing meeples on each new tile of a road that I am building, or is that I place one guy on a city, and that makes the city mine and I can not place anyone inside anymore?
3) How many times can I change the tile for another one if it doesnt fit?
4) What happens to the meeples in a city if the city is not finished but blocked? Do you get them back? Can this even happen?
5) The fields extend as long as even a part of it is not blocked by a city or road?

Sorry for the text, I feel like the rulebook does not explain the game in enough detail.

Respuesta 1:
1 - All sides must match any currently placed tiles. What happens in the future is of no concern. This is how you can be aggressive in Carcassonne, by deliberately placing tiles in such a way that impossible-to-fill spaces are left. It's very rare you'll ever be unable to place a tile, when that happens discard it and draw another.

2 - Once you place a meeple on a feature (a city, road, etc) then that feature is occupied and no-one can place more meeples on it. I cannot add a tile to "your" road and then plonk my meeple on that road, but I could place a meeple on a unoccupied city or farm space on that just-placed tile.

THAT SAID, it is possible for separate features to later become joined up. In this case, when the feature is completed, the points go to the person who has the most meeples on that feature. This is how you "fight" for high scoring cities, by placing tiles with currently unconnected city areas, and then playing to join them up.

3 - See 1. If on the rare occasion you genuinely cannot place a tile anywhere, you discard it can draw another. You will not always be able to place a tile where it benefits you. So, play it to the edge of the board (where it should be trivial to find one matching side) or place in such a way to make an opponents feature harder or impossible to complete.

4 - They're stuck there until the end of the game, where they score 1 point per tile. This is the trick of Carcassonne, once you commit a meeple to the board it's stuck there until you complete that feature. Risk/Reward.

5 - Correct. Fields are bounded by roads, city walls, the river and the board edge. Note that farmers are never recalled during the game, and only score points at the end, even if during the game a field becomes "complete" and has a boundary all the way round. Farmers can score huge points, but placing them early can lead to them getting stuck in low scoring fields. But if you wait too late, the big fields might already be claimed.

Respuesta 2:
Hi Luxenbau,
You have alot of questions there. Have you look through WikiCarpedia
Personally if you have no one to teach you it would be as helpful to buy it on a platform like Steam (cheap) and play the game there with yourself and other people until it begins to make sense. Perhaps many of these questions will have melted away at that point.
Cheers and good gaming

Can i still place it or I must make sure that all sides of a tile match the tiles it would be adjacent to?
All the sides must match. The rule about "at least one side" means that you can't place it so that it's only diagonally adjacent to other tiles - there must be a tile along at least one side of the new tile.

Quote:
2) How many meeples can I placed in a single city or road? Can I just keep placing meeples on each new tile of a road that I am building, or is that I place one guy on a city, and that makes the city mine and I can not place anyone inside anymore?
No-one may place a meeple on any feature (city, road, farm) that already has a meeple. The only way in the base game that two meeples can be on the same feature is if they were originally on separate features that got connected.

Quote:
3) How many times can I change the tile for another one if it doesnt fit?
You may not exchange the tile unless it doesn't fit anywhere at all. This is very rare and will probably not come up more than once or twice per game, if that. If you do exchange it for another tile that doesn't fit anywhere either, there is no limit on how many times you may exchange it.

But be careful to check it really doesn't fit anywhere, in any orientation! It's easy to miss a possibility once a lot of tiles have been placed.

Quote:
4) What happens to the meeples in a city if the city is not finished but blocked? Do you get them back? Can this even happen?
It can, and those unfortunate meeples simply remain trapped there until the end of the game!

Quote:
5) The fields extend as long as even a part of it is not blocked by a city or road?
Yes. Everything extends until it is stopped (by a wall in the case of cities, a road nd piece in the case of roads, or being blocked by a road or city in the case of fields).

Also, check out WikiCarpedia - a very useful resource for Carcassonne rules.


Edit: Argh, double-ninja'd! Hopefully my answers will still be useful.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks for all of your replies. One thing that I didnt get was about ME placing additional meeples on a single road that I am building. Ex: i place a road piece and a meeple, other players place whatever, but not on my road. I pull a road again and continue on my road, can I place a SECOND meeple on it? So it would be 2 meeples on 1 road? ( same question to cities ). Is there any point to this?

No. Once a feature (road/city/farm) has a meeple on it, you may not add another. It does not matter who the first meeple belongs to.
As others have said the only way to add meeples to a feature is to create a separate feature then join them up. It would be wasteful to add meeples to a feature anyway unless you are trying to win control. Extra meeples do NOT score extra points.

Respuesta 6:
Doesn't matter who owns the features, once it's claimed, no-one can place another meeple on it. Pictures would help but I'm at work, maybe this will help.

You place a road ( - ) and place a meeple on it. If you or anyone else then extends that road ( - - ) then another meeple cannot be placed on that road. You/they could place a meeple on the farmland or city to either side, but the road is already claimed by you and therefore off-limits.

Question - Since I have not placed a meeple, clearly I can withdraw my abbot. BUT - can I then afterwards (in the same turn) place that abbot on the garden I have just laid?

No. You place a meeple OR reclaim your abbot.

Tema 79: Scoring incomplete but not continuous city
Pregunta:
Hi, we are new to Carcassonne and found ourselves with this layout at the end of the game (base game). We cannot agree on how to score this incomplete city (or cities depending on your point of view): 1 point to Green and 2 to Blue, or is it 0 points to Green and 5 to Blue because Blue could be considered to have control of the city (even though it’s incomplete)? In this base game set there is only one tile that could fit in the hole, which is the 100% city tile, so it could only ever have been a single city, not multiple cities. But because the tile was never placed there perhaps it’s irrelevant and wouldn’t be taken into account in the scoring? At the end of the day it’s just a collection of unconnected city tiles? Haven’t been able to find any threads with precisely this problem! Thanks in advance to anyone who can solve it!

Respuesta 1:
Because the pieces are not joined, they are considered separate cities, and each piece is scored separately, at a rate of 1 point per tile.

So it's 2 points to blue and 1 point to green.

Respuesta 2:
I would count that as four incomplete cities, so 1 point to green, 2x1 to blue, and no-one scores the two points for the unclaimed city.

Respuesta 3:
In the expansions there are tiles that could fit in and make it 4 separate cities, 3 separate cities, maybe 2 separate cities, or 1 big city. But you don't score on what could've been but what is.

Basically the builder would end up being connected to my opponents meeple and or builder if I put the builder on the tile i just placed. Can I do this?

Thank you

Respuesta 1:
There should be a clarification in the booklet..
A builder isn’t considered a true meeple..

Respuesta 2:
Short answer- yes

They are two actions... place the tile (that will connect... or not) then place the meeple (or builder) on the tile just places... builder can be placed in a castle that already has one of your meeples. It does not affect the meeple count for who wins the castle... the builder does not count as a meeple for that purpose.

Respuesta 3:
I know that a builder is not considered a meeple. I know that a meeple can not be placed on a city segment that is connected to any other city segment with a knight(meeple) on it. So, I figured, since I didn't see it anywhere in the rulebook and a builder is not a meeple, that a builder CAN be placed on a city segment that IS connected to any other city segment with a knight on it. But, I wanted to clarify my assumption.

Respuesta 4:
So my assumption is correct? Sorry lol.

Respuesta 5:
You’re correct

Respuesta 6:
Also, I know it can be connected to my knight, im just talking about an opponents knight.

You need your knight in the city to later add your builder. An opponent's knight can be in the city as well, but you must have at least one of your own knights present.



Tema 81: Can I score both an early abbot and a completed acrobat pyramid?
Pregunta:
The Abbot rules
wrote:
On your turn during action 2 (Placing a meeple), if you decide not to place a meeple, you are allowed to take back your abbot. If you do so, you score as many points as the abbot is worth at that time, exactly like an end game monastery final scoring.
Under the Big Top rules
wrote:
Instead of placing a meeple or any other figure during 2. Placing a meeple, you can score a completed pyramid.
So rules as written, I can do both, correct?

Respuesta 1:
Generally speaking, you are allowed to do one “Instead of...” action per turn if you don’t do a placement action. Many Carcassonne players call any such action a “Move wood” action since you are either placing or moving wood pieces around the board. I agree that the rules are annoyingly unclear about such things.

Respuesta 2:
You either place 1 or remove 1 (outside of normal scoring for completions)
so pulling an abbot and scoring a pyramid would be 2 turns



Tema 82: Placing tile in someone else's city -- but not placing meeple
Pregunta:
Sorry if this has been answered in the forum -- I could not find it.

Is it legal to place a tile in someone else's city if you do not place a meeple?

This happened 2 times in a game I played yesterday. The reason the person would do it is to make the city larger -- anticipating that they would be able to be able to place a meeple on the city in the future.

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
That is a legal move, yes. Not saying it's necessarily a great move, but it is legal.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, there is nothing wrong with that. Infact, with the Cathedrals (from Inns and Cathedrals) module, it's usually a solid tactic to stop somebody from completing the city.

Respuesta 3:
As long as the tile edges match, a tile can be placed anywhere.

Respuesta 4:
Not only is it legal, sometimes there is no other choice. For example when the piece that is city on all four sides comes up, and cannot be played on a city of yours, but can be played on someone else's.

Respuesta 5:
Placing the tile is never blocked unless the edges don’t match up.. it’s only if another meeple is already there that would block a meeple placement ..

Respuesta 6:
To elaborate further: Placing a tile and placing a meeple are two different steps in the turn.

Tema 86: Carcassonne
Pregunta:
Hi guys,

A couple of months ago I bought a carcassonne game and in this time my partner and I had some contradiction about the rules.

The most recent was... If in a city is the witch and in another is the wizard, both the cities belonging to my partner, but I put a card which will make only one city from those two, who will move the witch or the wizard? Me because it is my turn, or my partner because it is her city?

Second...
I know when we place the river we can't go twice in same direction, but for example we can go once left, the next forward and the third card to go again left?!

Third...
When we finish more features in one turn, and we play with mesagers, we need to add all the points and to move just one of the maple and the mesager?
It can happen to finish a five points road and to move one of them because I will get a golden card, and after that to move the other one because I finished a church and to put another 9 points.

That's all for now, I hope it is OK I posted it here and sorry if it is another thread about carcassonne somewhere.

Respuesta 1:
I don't play with witch, wizard, messenger, or golden cards.

I can answer your question about the river. Yes, you can turn one tile right and the next tile left. You just can't turn them all the same direction to curve around into a circle.

Welcome to the Geek.

There is a special page for every game on Board Game Geek. To find the Carcassonne page, look at the top of your screen. On the left is the red blob with BGG. Then there are six words (Browse, Forums . . . ) On the right is a white box with "Search."

Type Carcassonne into that Search box. You will see a list of at least 20 versions of Carcassonne. Click on the version you have.

When the game page opens, scroll down a little. Just below the black opening screen is a line of words: (Overview, Ratings, Forums, Images . . .)

Click on Forums. Scroll down a little. On the left are 11 choices (All, Reviews, Sessions, General, Rules . . .) That's where all the questions about rules have been answered. But there are 439 of them, and that's too many to look through to find your answer.

So, instead, on the right side of that screen is a blue box: "New Post." Click on that. Above all the yellow faces it says "Select a Forum." Select Rules. Then type your questions.

Respuesta 2:
Each game item has their own forums. You can find the games using the search box at the top. Your questions also cover quite a few expansions it seems, so   might be a good place.

Note: do not cross-post. You can ask for this thread to be moved by clicking on the three dots at the top and choosing "Wrong Forum" and preferably add a reply to indicate the desired target forum.

I don't think that was the question, quite - but as you say, the rules about the river are to prevent it from turning in on itself. So yes it is possible to put down a left turn, then a straight bit, then another left turn.



Tema 87: Scoring incomplete cities
Pregunta:

Correct, maybe the sentence structure wasn't the best, also I didn't want to repeat what was already said in the thread, just add to it (i.e. incomplete roads also score, and when scoring you count tiles and shields - even for "strange-shaped" cities each tile is counted only once).

This is because our set has the rules in French (which we both read fluently) rather than English and because "house" was easier to explain to the kids, so we never used the standard terms. It's a pretty good indicator that we've never played with people we didn't teach the game to...

Yes, if all players in the city are meeple tied, all they score equal. Remember that incomplete cities give just one point per tile and one point per pendant, instead of the normal two points. Also, if all people playing had tied presence in the city, then you could chose to ignore those points because all players would gain the very same.

Tema 88: I need a definitive answer on this
Pregunta:
So how does it work: can you build on a foundation or tower, or close a tower off whenever you don't place a meeple, no matter the tile you got? Or can you do one of those 3 options only if you don't place a meeple AND got a tower foundation tile? I always thought you could do it on any turn. But there are YouTube video's (https://youtu.be/5jJCTPsd6xA) where people play it that you can only build on towers when you get a tower foundation tile. Also I was talking to someone on Reddit and they posted this: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/5GhBTRK

So what is it?

Per old rules, you don't need to play a tower foundation tile to do those things, just respect the no deploying follower condition. But this could be changed in the new edition, I'll check it.

Tema 89: Solo variant- works with Farmers and/or mini expansions?
Pregunta:
I’ve been getting in to the official solo variant for Carcassonne and quite enjoy it. The rules which I’ve printed only cover base game (excluding farmers rules aswell). However in the most recent printing the game comes with Abbot + Rivers in the box.

Has anyone tried it with any/all of:
- Farmer rules
- Abbot mini expansion
- River mini expansion
?

I would like to add in these for more interesting games but can see some problems:

- Farmers- might break the game as you’re bound to run out of meeples... plus if you HAVE to place a meeple on a tile with a “free” feature then you’ll almost always have to put one down on an empty field

- River- in theory works fine, but might tie up meeples early on in the game and increase risk of running out/losing

- Abbot- possibly most likely to fit in with the game ok, however when would you take your abbot back? when you don’t have to play a meeple only?

Would be interested to hear others’ thoughts on this and what you may have tried? Or if there are any official FAQs about including these extra rules

Respuesta 1:
Hello,
I also tried the 'official' solo variant. It is not the most challenging solo variant. But with those rules, it seems you can play with expansions.
Unfortunatly, as the rules says, you won't play any farmer.
For the Abbot, it seems it could be OK, but don't forget to score your points according to the solo rules... (Sometimes, your abbot won't score any points)
I've never tried with any expansion, but reading the rules, it seems to be playable with the river to because there are tiles that cannot recieve a meeple.

Tema 90: Abbot + normal meeple on 1 cloister

I could place it in the same cloister as my normal meeple so I did. In the following turn I removed my abbot for 8 points, so only my normal meeple was left on the cloister.

Placing the last tile of the river is a turn like any other. If using The River II, the last tile will be a volcano, on which you cannot place a meeple (and where the dragon appears, if you use that expansion), and the rules instruct the player who places it to take another turn by drawing the first non-river tile.

2. What's the status of the regular first tile of base game with river expansion. Is it mandatory to place that tile after completing river or it is it also shuffled like other base tiles and is picked randomly?
According to the original expansion, you're supposed to remove the usual start tile from the game. I believe the Big Box edition specified that you could place it as the next tile after the river, or mix it in with the other tiles to be drawn. (Personally I just toss it in with the rest, since my draw method involves not seeing the backs of the tiles anyway.)

However sometimes we play without the farmers rule and in these instances we count both the source and end of the river as non-turns

Respuesta 2:
The app plays like it doesn't count and gives you another turn. Do with that what you will.

Respuesta 3:
I would say give an extra turn unless they play a meeple on that tile.

Respuesta 4:
The iOS app implements the final tile behavior in accordance with the rules for River II for some reason. It makes sense for River II because you can’t place a meeple on the volcano tile, but is not necessary for the River I.

I can’t see any reason that the player should get an extra turn with River I. There are many river tiles where all you can do is place a farmer so it’s not like there’s some special compensation that needs to be made.

As for the non-River start tile— if you put the tiles in stacks then definitely leave it out. I believe the rules effectively say this at least for the most recent Carcassonne box.

Also, look for the Carcassonne Complete Annotated Rules PDF. It is very well researched and thorough.

Hope this helps!

In a rules document with the Rio Grande Games logo and © 2000 Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH there is a short paragraph in smaller type on the bottom of page 4, the final page. The bolded paragraph title is Rules for using the 12 expansion river tiles.

It states:

When the 10 river tiles have been played, the next player plays
the lake and then play continues with the normal tiles.

I readily interpret that does not support "giving an extra turn ...", which I believe would have to have been more explicitly stated if it was meant to be true.

In the light of various suggestions..i think you’re suggestion is the most valid...
Very curious why this is the "most valid." "I would say" sounds like an opinion, not an interpretation of rules.

I have two sets of rules, one from 2014 that adds The River and The Abbot only. This one says:
Quote:
Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise one after the other, players place tiles as usual (including the possibility of placing a meeple), with the exception that they must draw tiles from the River tile stack. You must continue drawing from the River stack until it runs out of tiles.
It says a bit earlier to "slide the lake tile under that stack," referring to the stack of river tiles, so it'll be last. But nowhere does it mention that last tile being placed "automatically" or that person getting another turn. Granted, the only thing anyone can do is place a farmer, but that's true in many other cases. If this were the case it should explicitly state so, otherwise you're reading into what it says.
It reference to the start tile, this set of rules also says:
Quote:
The River is comprised of 12 River tiles with a dark back that replace the start tile. When playing with The River, return the start tile to the box.
(Emphasis mine.)

I have another set of rules from 2017 that's from a Big Box edition. These rules are a bit shorter. It says "...players place tiles normally. However, players must draw and place all river tiles before they can draw normal tiles." There's still nothing about the last tile being placed automatically. And as to the setup, it says the same as the above version, basically saying these tiles replace the start tile.

Granted, I don't think I've seen any other rules and I don't know about The River II or the app. So I'm just quoting what 2 sets of rules are saying, and I think those are pretty clear. Carcassonne does unfortunately have some inconsistencies, but the above all makes sense to me.



Tema 92: Retrieving & Scoring Farmer
Pregunta:
I realize the rules state that farmers are not to be removed or scored until the end of the game to determine who has control over the fields and to count the total number of completed cities, but if in the middle of the game, a single farmer is located within a looped road along with one or two completed small cities, couldn't the unchallenged meeple be scored and retrieved? What's the point in waiting?

Respuesta 1:
While that farmer's value might be locked in, you don't get it back until the end of the game. It's possible to run out of meeples.

Also, some expansions have rules which care where meeples are on the board, like the Dragon.

Respuesta 2:
No you cannot. No reason you cannot house rule it though.

The reason is that farmers are high risk - high reward. If you can retrieve farmers early, it makes them more appealing as they are very strong.

Respuesta 3:
The point is that you never retrieve farmers. Farmers are a double edge sword: they may score quite a lot of points, but at the expanse of reducing your pool of available meeples forever.
You may of course play whichever way you want, but farmers are not supposed to be able to come back in the game (at least in the base game, not sure what may happen if expansions or stand alone are mixed in)

Respuesta 4:
It would create incentives for players to commit a meeple as a farmer earlier on the game, and then looping them in with roads if things don't go the way they wanted so the meeple can be recovered later.

I know it's a convoluted situation and there might never come the day where people would actually do this, but that also mean recovering looped-in farmers would be hardly useful at all.

Respuesta 5:
It's part of the strategy in the game. Meeples are a limited resource and you always have to consider if and when you should place one.

Farms tie up the meeple. You committed the meeple to the farm, and you're not going to get it back.

It's the same as meeples being locked in cities and roads that are not possible to finish.

Respuesta 6:
Your partner/sibling/child/opponent locked your early farmer into the road didn't they?

krypto 1
@krypto1
What's the point in waiting?
Because that's the rules for the farmers, that's their trade-off. Farmers can potentially score huge points but they can be very risky and require a lot of management during the game to expand their territory and keep them safe. You goofed up and someone saw the opportunity to lock you out of a meeple for the game. Learn from it, do it back to them if the opportunity arises. I wouldn't house rule it, as @Travalgar said, reclaiming farmers early via a house rule will unbalance the game.

If you want to be able to reclaim farmers during the game officially, you'll need one of the expansions. Either have them eaten by the Dragon (Princess & The Dragon) or use a Barn to score one field early and retrieve the farmers from it (Abbey & The Mayor).

Carcassonne is not a nice, pleasant game of making lovely cities. It's a vicious knife fight where every tile matters.

Respuesta 7:
"Your partner/sibling/child/opponent locked your early farmer into the road didn't they?"
To be honest, it never came up in a real situation... it was something that I always wondered about.

Thank you to all for the input, and to those that reminded the implications with certain expansions and the pros/cons to house ruling this scenario.

Respuesta 8:
I think also that if you allowed it for a looped road, whats to say it would not happen with larger farms that are completely surrounded by roads and cities? Then it becomes a slippery slope.

If you have this mini expansion [Carcassonne: The Festival ] or the new one you place the tile and play it as usual or TAKE A MEEPLE BACK INSTEAD



Tema 93: Cities game end scoring
Pregunta:
So, during gameplay, it is understood that if one player has the majority amount of Knights in a complete city, they shall be the only one to receive the scoring once the city is complete.

Tema 94: Farmer scoring question
Pregunta:
In the image below, I am the blue player. I scored 39 points for farmers and I don't quite understand why. The farmer closer to the top right scored 30 and the one towards the bottom left scored 9. It seems to me I should only have scored 30 because it looks like both farmers belong to the same field. What am I seeing wrong?

Respuesta 1:
Never mind. I see it now. The farms are definitely separated. Oops.

Respuesta 2:
Now I'm missing it...
blue farmer on the right is feeding 9 completed cities, so 27pts
blue farmer on the left is feeding 3 completed cities, so 9pts

I'm still puzzled but I begin to think of another possible explanation. Even though I have been here at BGG for more than a decade I learned only quite recently that for a very brief time in the very very very beginning Carcassonne had Farmer scoring based upon the CITY viewpoint of which Farmers best supplied the City. Now it is done from the viewpoint of the Farmers as to how many Cites are supplied (or something like that).

In the later Carcassonne (IIRC, 3rd edition or later), you score by fields, NOT cities. So in the OP's image, instead looking at the cities and saying "who gets these pts?".. you look at each field, determine who has the most farmers, and that player gets 3pts per completed city.

If the left meeple were red, then red would get 9pts from 3 completed cities, while blue would get 30pts (including an overlap of those same, 3 cities).

They would've shared the points, just like with a city or road, so 9 points each.

In original rules, each city paid FOUR VPs to whoever has the most farmers serving it. But that usually ended up with huge points for one person, so the new method was adopted to prevent wild end game swings. Just trying to help...

Tema 96: When both your and another player's meeple is in the same feature
Pregunta:
Let's say Player A puts their meeple/follower down in one end of a city

And Player B puts theirs down on another unconnected city tile

Player A then gets a tile that connects the two city tiles. So on one end is a city tile already occupied by Player A's meeple, and on the other is one occupied by Player B's.

So on that new tile placed by Player A in the middle, can Player A put the meeple down to overpower Player B?

(The same problem also applies to roads)

Respuesta 1:
no, as once you put the tile down both A & B are already in the feature, and iirc, you could only add a builder..

My question is on RE-use of the abbot. Can you put the abbot back down in the same garden or monastery you picked him up from (on your next turn)? And then pick him back up on the turn after that and score points AGAIN for that same garden or monastery??

Tema 99: When do you pick up your next time ?
Pregunta:
I've played against several players that have all interpreted the rules slightly differently. I pick up as soon as my turn is complete, it speeds up the game as by the time it's my turn I've assessed the options and barring any 'bombshells' dropped by my opponents the game progresses nicely. The problem is at the end, some with the expansion packs have a second go (builder) some need to pick two cards (hills). It always causes a little discussion at the end...I'd love to be able to wave this phone in everyone's face and say HA. Obviously I'd I'm wrong I'll keep it to myself!

Respuesta 4:
It's a random draw anyway, since it's a random shuffle. But I agree that playing with your particular expansion you'll need to pick up before placing towards the end of the game. Our group agrees with you - pick up after placing to reduce the AP. Makes the game much more enjoyable to play.

Respuesta 5:
for builder., you wouldn’t know what your next tile is., nor would you know the one under the hill.
drawing early or draw 3 would be variants.,
trouble with variants (and house rules) is they don’t always work once you add extras.

Respuesta 6:
The way you do it would work, if you do it like this:
1. You draw a tile
2. While you think, next player draws his tile but doesn't show it (so as not to give the advantage to you as a previous player - for example, if you saw that next player has just drawn THE tile he needed, you could change your decision and block him instead. So, no picking!)
3. Repeat step 2 for the desired number of players, all tiles are concealed
4. By the time you place a tile, everybody has already drawn their tiles and has been thinking about it, so you draw your tile and don't show.

That way, there is no breaking the rules whatsoever (everybody draws in a strict line, no cut-ins) and the downtime of opponent thinking is reduced dramatically.

The important thing to note is this way of playing doesn't work if you have builders or hills, since you don't have any idea whether it will be 1 or 2 tiles drawn.

We do the same thing. We draw a tile immediately after we place the tile and have the bag ready for the next person when they place.

Respuesta 10:
The main reason why I believe that the rules say to pick up at the beginning of your turn is to avoid situations where, for example, player B sees that by strategically placing your tile and player B's tile in the next turn in such or such manner, it would benefit you both. Basically, it opens the game to negotiations (if you place your tile here, I can place mine there and blablabla).

Respuesta 11:
I couldn't imagine playing the game by drawing at the beginning of your turn. It. Would. Drag... We have players that can't decide where to put their tile as it is after having it in their hand the entire round - it would be far worse if they didn't see the tile til the start of their turn. We have always played - play one, draw one. If we are playing with the Builder we keep two tiles in hand. The builder tile must be the second tile in your hand - you don't get to draw another one just to make a builder play - and if you play your second tile then you draw back up with two tiles.

The "asking for advice" reference may not be recognized by those who have more recently come to the game. Missing from contemporary Z-Man rules is a particular "instruction" contained in the earlier Rio Grande rules as to what a player does immediately after drawing a tile,

Tema 100: Messenger scoring question
Pregunta:
This was probably a one-in-a-million situation, so I had no idea how to handle it.

I place a tile that simultaneously finishes two cities I control. I score the smaller city, moving my Messenger onto a dark scoring tile, and draw a message tile. It's the one that scores your city with the lowest score. That city happens to be the second city I just completed; I have no others on the board.

What to do?

I thought I would ignore it and just get the 2 points since the city was "in scoring" and thus not legitimately "in play". The other people playing with me thought it was valid and told me to essentially score it twice. That's not the entire reason I won the game, but it was certainly a huge boost.

So which is it? Should my win in that game have been by a lower margin?

Respuesta 1:
I don't have Messenger Expansion myself so I am not that familiar with the rules, but here is what I can understand reading the rules online.
I can see two different way to interpret yhis.
1) You score that first city (first) and move your token and then take the messenger tile.
By doing this you can score that one remaining city as a messager before scoring it normally. But Messenger scores the city as if it were the end of the game so you don't score it double (but still will receive some extra points for sure).
2) You score all your features at the same time and only after everything has been scored you look if you can score the Messenger.
This way you wouldn't be able to score that completed city, but I also feel it is not the way the rules are written.

By going option 1 there is also the possibility to score multiple Messengers in the same turn. Is this the intention? I have no idea.

Respuesta 2:
I don't think the two cities should score separately. When you place a tile, you score everything that completes together. Once you're done with that, the messenger can trigger.

Tema 101: Monastery scoring
Pregunta:
On a recent game I played, I had a scenario where two of my monasteries were side-by-side and nearly complete. Only one tile was needed to complete both. I drew another Monastery which fit the last spot legally to complete both. That monastery that I picked up also went inside an empty spot surrounded by 8 tiles as well. It was perfect. My question is if I am allowed to claim the points for that Monastery as well considering that I just cashed in points for the two completed previous monasteries I already owned. At the time, I took the 27 points thinking how perfect and exciting it was. No one else contested. But thinking about it now, I'm not sure if I was allowed to claim points for that final Monastery tile I just laid down.

Respuesta 1:
That’s sounds perfectly correct! Nice draw!

Well...if I'm not mistaken, one is not allowed to score points and then lay a claim with a meeple on the same turn. However, I suppose this only means on the same tile just played?

In my understanding this rule is in place so that in case you don't have any meeples free to play you cannot score points and then place your meeple from the ones you received that turn.
In general the rules are quite clear.
1) You place meeple on the tile you have just placed.
2) You score all the points from your completed structures.

I am pretty interested now why Manny thinks he is not able to score those points? Since I cannot really come up with any reason. And also no one in his game group had any ideas.

To my way of thinking, You already had 16 of those points (8 for each of the nearly completed monasteries); they just hadn't shown up on the scoring track yet. Still, a net gain of 11 points for one tile placement (and the release of multiple meeples) is a great turn!

Tema 103: Question on the Hills and Sheep Expansion
Pregunta:
Aside from being a visual representation of that area being a hill, it takes an unknown tile out of the game. This can be a welcome change for players who know the tile count so well that they can predict whether certain features can be completed, etc. It also helps when you’re playing against those players.

Respuesta 1:
The extra step of hiding a tile highlights there’s a hill too

Respuesta 2:
Also, a meeple on a hill wins a tie for majority. So, the hill is a visual reminder as well as removing a tile from play. (You cannot look at it either).

Respuesta 3:
Completely agree with you. We always play with this rule in mind (red flag helps), but not using up some random tile - tile-counting mechanic is one of the game's cores, I think.

Respuesta 4:
I never play Carcassonne without this expansion, I consider it as essential as Inns & Cathedrals . First of all, because of the vineyards (for symmetry), but also because of the hills rules: it kills the tile counters' lame strategy.

Respuesta 5:
Yes, but some strategy says, use tiles from expansions you are not using (I'm not using this, but it can be sollution)
But for tiles counter will not agree with this.
Anyway, it's horrible with playing Fruit Baring Trees. You are waiting for next fruit tile for sell your fruits (of course 4 different kind to get 15 points), and last 2 tiles are not comming. And then after end of game you realized that fruit tree tiles is under hills.

Respuesta 6:
Perhaps a simple fix for using Hills with Fruit Baring Trees is to always allow the player drawing the tile to put under a hill to look at the tile. If it's a fruit tree tile put it back in the pile of face down tiles and draw another one.

Respuesta 7:
I will say that the Hills & Sheep expansion—specifically the Hills—is the only thing I have disliked so far in my experiences with Expansions 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 9.

There is something unholy and hideous about the tiles being stacked like that that is impossible to ignore. I will probably never open the box again.



Tema 104: Unplayable space?
Pregunta:
Hi again, all! Another question for you... Played Carcassonne last night, and we had a situation where there was a very large, unfinished city. My wife had control of it (two meeples to one), so I was trying to ensure it didn't get finished. I placed a tile so that the only space where the city could have been finished was surrounded. To finish the city, she would have needed a piece which closes cities at each end, with a road curving from the side into one of the cities. She felt that my move was illegal as there is no piece (we believe) that would have fitted. I thought that as long as my piece was placed legally, it didn't matter if an empty space was unplayable. (I should have taken a photo of the situation to show you, sorry). Anyway - any ideas? Was my move legal?? Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
your move was legal and there is at least one piece in the game that fits any situation of a surrounded empty space.

In your wife's case it seems that piece had already been placed somewhere before you caused that conundrum. A lot of the strategy in this game is exactly about making it harder for your opponent to finish their segments (castles or roads or cloisters).

Yes, of course it was. Jut because your opponent doesn’t like it, doesn’t make it illegal. There’s nothing in the rules to say it should be, and it’s one of the tools in your arsenal for good competitive play. Now, whether you actually want to play that competitively or not is up to you. Some prefer a friendlier game.

Respuesta 3:
Also as a side note I would say that it's almost impossible to remember by heart every piece that is in the game. If you'd play with a rule that a move is illegal if there is not piece in the game that would fit the remaining space it would mean you'd have to have a print-out of all the pieces in the game and then look into it after every move to make sure that there is still a piece left that would fit.

It's like in all games: People who played a game a lot have an advantage because they know the components which didn't appear yet.

This might be slight off topic, but I still think relevant to the underlying OP’s question of a blocking move, (and yes your move was perfectly 'legal').

I played this game 100’s of times with my wife and we got into a mindset of a strange kind of semi-coop game. Of course I’m going to tease a bit but it was to, ‘save the marriage’ We would even make joking remark as we picked up a good screwage tile, ‘I’ve got a divorce tile’, meaning I’ve got the perfect tile to mess with your plans, and we also know the response it would elicit. Understand we are happily married, (with 6 grandchildren), and in no need of counselling, (we’ll see how we do after months of home isolation)! We now play more competitively than when we started out but I know we will still hold back on some of our potential moves.

At one point I thought I was getting pretty good at this game so wanted to try some competitive play, was I in for a shock! Our bucolic, pastureland, fun-loving map building game was really more akin to a knife fight in a closet! Before, you get a-tap-a-tapping on that keyboard in response to that last response. I’m not saying that’s what the game is, I’m saying that is how unprepared I was for competitive play. I had to relearn the game and I can say that blocking moves are a part of the competitive game and that’s not a bad thing. For the most part the folks I played with at, what I deem as a competitive level, (one player went to #3 in the world tournament that year), understand the style of play and there wasn’t a hint of meanness in their demeanour or personality. This is still my most played game and remains one of the favourites in my collection and agree that the play style can be adapted to the person(s) across the table.

Tema 105: Abbot question...
Pregunta:
Hi all...two questions from a Carcassonne newbie. Trying to step up to the Abbot mini expansion, but bit confused.

Question 1.

The rules say:

Placing a meeple OR your abbot
When placing a tile with a mastery or a garden, you may place either a meeple or your abbot.
The meeple is placed as usual whereas the abbot must be placed on the monastery or garden you've just placed.

My question is about the last sentence - I thought meeples were meant to be placed on tiles you've just laid, therefore what's the difference between a meeple and an abbot here?

Question 2.

The rules say:

As you can see, gardens are scored exactly like monastery, with the exception that only an abbot may be placed on them.

Question - this says that only an abbot can be placed on a garden, but in the rules above, it says you can place either a meeple or abbot on a garden. Help..!?

Thanks, clever people...

Respuesta 1:
it means that if you choose to place a meeple you can only place it on any of the other elements on that tile (castle, road or field).

Hope this helps answering both questions

Respuesta 2:
Maybe Wikicarpedia can help:

Respuesta 3:
You are answer yourself in your post, read it with attention.

The abbot is just an special unique meeple each player have.

EDIT: Maybe you were confusing abbot with monk? A regular meeple is called monk once on a monastery, but the abbot is a unique kind of meeple that can't be used as a regular meeple (it has special abilities/restrictions).

Respuesta 4:
Pedro Pereira
@Pedrator

Yes, place a tile and:
1) either choose meeple and place it on:
  a) field/road/city (if those features exist on the tile)
  b) or on monastery, like abbot (but then he has to wait for the monastery to finish = 8 surrounding tiles)
2) or choose abbot and place it on the monastery or garden – he can be taken back in any future turn (instead of placing a meeple that turn) and scored.

Tema 106: Final Scoring Seems Inconsistent
Pregunta:
Haven't played this in a few years...playing a lot of oldies these days of lockdown.

I'd forgotten how much we enjoyed this game, but I also remember the odd final scoring thing: For incomplete cities you get half the score of a completed city. This seems reasonable. But it doesn't seem right to then get full score for incomplete roads? Shouldn't roads be less valuable if incomplete?

Respuesta 1:
Maybe, what about cloisters?

Respuesta 2:
The intention of this is to bring a certain balance/strategy playing the game rather than a certain balance in the endgame scoring. Incomplete cloisters also give 1 point per tile, and make them and roads scoring a half point will change the way of gaming, maybe forcing some changes in the tiles distribution etc. Lakes in the first expansion makes some comple roads score 2 points per tile and some incomplete roads 0 points per tile, and personally consider that change better, because balance both "during game" and "end game" phases.

Respuesta 3:
Cloisters score only for the number of surrounding tiles, so an incomplete cloister would, by its nature, not score the maximum possible spoints.

Respuesta 4:
Jack North
@northjack
Shouldn't roads be less valuable if incomplete?
No, roads and cities are different in a few ways, one of which is that it's more important to complete cities for the scoring bonus. The game would likely be less interesting if roads were too much like cities. There is still significant incentive to complete your roads - you need to do that to get your followers back, and you only have seven.

Respuesta 5:
The thematic way I think about it is.... a road is a road, gets you places, it is what it is regardless of it ending at a crossroads or town or a cul-de-sac. However, a walled city with a hole in it is less useful or valuable!

Cloisters score only for the number of surrounding tiles, so an incomplete cloister would, by its nature, not score the maximum possible spoints.
Ummm. This quote from Rio Grande rules . . .

For an incomplete cloister,
the player with the monk on the cloister earns 1 point for the
cloister and 1 point for each land tile surrounding it.

Respuesta 7:
Yes, Tomello, I failed to say you get a point for the cloister itselft. What I was trying to explain, though, is a incomplete cloister will score something less than the 9 points of a complete cloister. If you only have 4 tiles surrounding it, you'll get 5 points. By the nature of its scoring, each tile gets its usual 1 point, but the cloister doesn't get its maximum score. So incomplete cities score less, incomplete cloisters score less, but ithere is no scoring "penalty" for incomplete roads.

It's not a complaint, it's just an observation. I wondered why there was a difference.

Respuesta 8:
I think it misleading to suggest that incomplete Cloisters score at a "penalty". Just like an incomplete Road, they score a point for each tile present. It simply happens that you know its maximum.

Twisting this, would you say that a Road scores a penalty becuase it could have been a 12 point road, given the appropriate tiles ?

It's not a complaint, it's just an observation. I wondered why there was a difference.
But that’s the same as roads. One point per tile, whether complete or not.

The only difference is with cities, which give reduced points if they are incomplete. This makes players focus more on completing their cities or blocking other people’s cities.

However, Inns & Cathedrals shakes this up a bit by introducing roads (and to a much lesser extent cities) that score nothing if not completed, and, to my mind, this vastly improves the game, making roads more interesting and worthwhile.

Yes, Tomello, I failed to say you get a point for the cloister itselft. What I was trying to explain, though, is a incomplete cloister will score something less than the 9 points of a complete cloister. If you only have 4 tiles surrounding it, you'll get 5 points. By the nature of its scoring, each tile gets its usual 1 point, but the cloister doesn't get its maximum score. So incomplete cities score less, incomplete cloisters score less, but ithere is no scoring "penalty" for incomplete roads.

Exactly, seems that Jack don't understand the basic "1 per tile" point, or really don't want to accept our answers to his question. The "recover follower" relevant during the game, which gives a difference between them, doesn't matters at the end game scoring. The way incomplete features score at the end makes the way of playing balanced in a specific way. So NO, incomplete roads don't need to alter their normal end game scoring, unles some expansion is used or an unofficial variant applied, but never for a basic official defaults unfair/fault.

Jack, that expansion don't make what you said, it adds additional points during the game and no points at the end of the game just for certain roads with the new feature. All other roads score the same, 1 point per complete tile during the game and 1 point per incomplete tile at the end of the game. Please, don't take my advice/guidance in the wrong way. All said by me is true, but not with bad intentions.

EDIT: Important to tell you that this expansion also adds some Cathedrals that makes cities with them score 3 points per tile during the game and no points per tile at the end of the game.

Tema 107: Road tile double scoring?
Pregunta:
We were playing for the first time last night and we had this road about to be closed on a crossroads. It didn't happen in the end, but we were wondering if the crossroads tile would score double (one for the middle road and one for the left road). We were okay with the double scoring only if completed. What do you think?

Respuesta 1:
Nope. Each tile only counts once. It’s the same for cities that have separated parts that get joined into one city.

Respuesta 2:
No, the tile only scores once. Same for cities where one tile has 2 city segments (as part of the same city). You score for *tiles* not road/city segments.

Edit: d by just 5 seconds!

Respuesta 3:
Long time readers of this forum know the answer well because the question comes up often enough.

In English, Contemporary Z-Man rules do use bold type meant to emphasize that the tile counts only once, but it is easily overlooked. Older rules language from Rio Grande games say it more clearly. (Bold as published in quotes below, but with my highlight)

Z-Man
When scoring a road, each tile of that road grants you 1 point.


Rio Grande
The player who has a thief on a completed road scores one
point for each tile in the completed road (count the
number of tiles; separate segments on a tile count just
once).

And Rio Grande illuminates further by giving a specific image of 4 tiles making a loop (for 4 points).

Tema 109: Share fields..legal move? Android app says no
Pregunta:
Hi folks, in the example green has just played a farmer on the field, to try to join red's field. However the official Android app says it is not possible to make this move, presumably as it thinks this is red's field.

Is this a legal move? Does that city wall split the fields as I thought, or is it in fact the same field?

Thanks for the clarification.

Respuesta 1:
Those are separate fields (for now) and it’s a perfectly legal move. As long as that’s the tile that was just placed, of course.

It is a legal move. And I feel like I have made that move in the app as well, though I haven't played it recently enough to be sure.

That's the only explanation I can find for that to happen.



Tema 110: Two roads complete at once, which scores?
Pregunta:
If two roads complete at once which scores? Or do I get to pick the longer of the two?

See pictured example. The tile with the town (and mee please) is the last to be placed if it matters.


Thanks in advance!

Respuesta 1:
They’re both eligible for scoring simultaneously. If there are no other meeples on the road when it completes, the player completing the road could choose to put their meeple on either.

Respuesta 2:
They would both potentially score. You would place your meeple on one or the other, assuming both were empty beforehand. If both already had a meeple on them, you couldn't place on either. If only one had a meeple on it already, you would obviously only be able to place on the other.

Respuesta 3:
In the last step of a turn you score all completed features. No choice.
1.Place tile
2.Optionally place a meeple on a single feature on the just placed tile (if allowed).
3.Score all completed features, return meeples.

It might help to put this another way: both roads score. Each road's points go to whoever has the most meeples on that road. Those meeples might have already been there, or one of them could be the one you place this turn. Perhaps one road is even empty, in which case the points disappear into thin air. But always, both roads generate points -- the only question is who gets them.

Respuesta 6:
The Phantom for the win.

Respuesta 7:
If you have previously claimed one of the roads, and no one has claimed the other, claim it and score both if both are completed. In the photo, claim the one you want, but not both.

Respuesta 8:
I hope you've just put the meeple there to show us which tile was just placed, and that you didn't actually put it there in the game. The meeple goes on the feature you're scoring, which would be a section of road. As everyone else has said, choose the longest road which does not yet have a meeple.

Respuesta 9:
Well, if you played with me I'd say that you had put your meeple clearly on the shorter road and the longer road is empty, so it's obvious that you score only the road that belongs to you — the shorter one

It's not a U-turn - this is using the expansion where the river forks. This river started out at the top of the picture, and both branches are heading downwards.

Respuesta 8:
that version is overly paranoid about river conflicts.
it won’t let 2 lines of river be placed orthogonally.. it often throws or restricts placement of perfectly fine tiles..

Respuesta 9:
Sadly, years ago rules changed to describe a U turn as an immediate one only, so having at least one tile between them enough to allow it. But I find that a big mistake due to common examples/situations like this, affecting the river construction or limiting future regular tiles placing. I sold my Carcassonne collection but, understanding this, I always play it deploying a ZigZag river, fulfilling its "starting tile" purpose in a safe and fun way. In the main post scenario, the first and conflictive curve that creates the first U turn is the center right one. With that tile as a ZigZag you wouldn't be in this dilemma. My strong advice, deploy the river always as a ZigZag.

Respuesta 10:
The truth is the game (app) knows which tiles are left in the pile/sack. Probably placing the straight river tile in the yellow squared place would create a situation where there's no available river tile (in pile/sack) that could match to adjacent tiles and end the river (like e.g. the road on the right).



Tema 112: City next to the River
Pregunta:
One of the River tiles that comes with the (current edition) base game has a city adjacent to each side of the river with just a thin strip of grass separating each city from the water. For each city, that thin strip of grass is sufficient to connect farm on either side of the city, right?

I'm having trouble finding a picture of what the tile in question looks like in the current edition.

Tema 113: Order of taking and playing pieces
Pregunta:
Hi,

When I place tile that finishes castle with my knight (let's say I don't have any other pieces in my available resources) is it possible to take it and put it on this tile on the same turn?

I've played like this but now I see that in rulebook scoring is after placing piece on tile. That would mean that when I score and get my knight back it's already to late to play it.

Respuesta 1:
If you don't have any spare meeples you can't place one.

You can place a tile that completes a feature, place a spare meeple on it, and then immediately score the feature and get that meeple back, though.

(What would be the advantage of taking a meeple from the city and immediately putting it back there anyway?)

Respuesta 2:
Your second statement is correct. You won't score and get back pieces until after a tile has been played, so your meeple is unavailable to go on the new tile, unfortunately.

It adds pressure to the choices you are forced to make by tying up your chances to score. Do you commit your last unit now and hope for the best, or potentially miss out on points in the hope of getting something better in the future.

Respuesta 3:

In English, the older rules from publisher Rio Grande Games quoted here spelled it out more explicitly than contemporary Z-Man Games.

Playing the game

Players take turns in clockwise order beginning with the starting player. On a player's turn, he executes the following actions in the order shown:

*The player must draw and place a new land tile.

*The player may deploy one of his followers from his supply to the land tile he just placed.

*If, by placing the land tile, cloisters, roads, and/or cities are completed, they are now scored.

Same rules as normal Carcassonne. Where the squares touch you can place a tile Orthogonally. So at the top where it touches scotland and where it touches Wales. Also looks like you can continue two roads.

Are there any pink starting towns in Ireland? If so you could start there as well and then build in the normal way. With the maps you can have multiple start points which eventually join together.



Tema 116: Removing one of two Meeples?
Pregunta:
Hoping to get clarification on this:

Player 1 lays a tile, places a meeple on a city segment.

Later, Player 1 lays another tile and places a meeple in another city segment. At this point, the cities are not joined.

Later still, Player 1 lays another tile, JOINING the aforementioned city segments. However, the city is not yet completed.

Can Player 1 reclaim one of his meeples? We suspect not, but wanted to check.

Would it matter if the same situation arises with a road? (Two independent roads claimed by the same player are joined, but are not yet completed.)

Thank you!

Respuesta 1:
Meeples don't come off until the feature is completed. At that point, the scoring goes to the player with the most meeples on the feature.

Respuesta 2:
Thank you!

Respuesta 3:
That's a part of strategy in Carcassonne. If you build and merge twice, you can take over someone's feature. There's also an expansion with a big meeple, which counts as two meeples.
You can also do that with a feature you already have a meeple on, thus protecting it from being taken over.

The same goes with roads and fields.

Respuesta 4:
And remember that you can't put a meeple in a city (or another feature) that already has a meeple in it. Even if it's your meeple. (It doesn't refer to special meeples like Builder etc.). The only way to populate the city (or another feature) with more meeples is like said above — build another, new fragment with a meeple and connect with your first fragment.

Tema 119: Bridge placement at 90 degrees
Pregunta:
I've been searching for an answer without success. We have a bridge crossing a field, joining two roads. 90 degrees adjacent to that I placed a monastery with a bridge over it, next to a road coming in. The bridge fulfills the rule of touching a field on both sides. My wife and son are morally offended that there's not a road on the other side of the bridge. The rules mention linear bridges but not perpendicular. But I see nothing that prohibits it. And it gives me control of all fields!
Thoughts?
Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
Can you post a picture example what it looks like? Curious.

Respuesta 2:
I see, you are referring to the Carcassonne: Expansion 8 – Bridges, Castles and Bazaars expansion.

Best I can tell from your post, they can be morally objected all they want, but it sounds completely legal.

Respuesta 3:
I'm not exactly sure what you're saying either.

You can't place a bridge somewhere in the middle of the tile - it must be on two opposite F sides of the tile. The bridge transforms those into R sides, and then the tile placement must abide by normal placement rules.

All other features that share the tile with the bridge ignore it.

Respuesta 4:
Gene Spears
@fallenpillars
You can't place a bridge somewhere in the middle of the tile - it must be on two opposite F sides of the tile.
The roads being bridged across the field must enter the field from opposite sides of the field tile. They cannot enter on adjacent sides of the field tile.

From the rulebook:
Quote:
You can place one bridge on the tile you just placed, or on a
tile touching the tile you just placed. When placing a bridge, you
must place both ends in a field, and it must be placed facing either left-to-right
or up-to-down (it cannot be placed diagonally across the tile). Once placed, a
bridge remains on that tile until the end of the game. You can place a tile so that a road ends against a field, but you must place a
bridge that continues the road on that same turn. You can use multiple bridges
in a row along the same road, but each tile can have a maximum of only one
bridge on it.

Respuesta 5:
I should have taken a picture. I won't be home until midnight, and the game is currently under cover. But if the bridge turns a field side into a road side, I might be wrong. Because my bridge goes into a field. But I don't see that in the rules.

Respuesta 6:
Wife and son provided photo!
Rule might be implicit, but upon re-reading it I maintain that it is not explicit.

Respuesta 7:
No, that is not allowed. The bridge continues the road - i.e. it turns the tile it’s on into one that has a road going through it. Basically, if it’s not permissible to place a tile with a normal road that way, it’s not permissible to use a bridge that way.

Respuesta 8:
Well, when you put it that way it makes perfect sense! I think we started playing too fast, and it doesn't say it that clearly in the rules. I think we're going to have to start over, because there's no way to untangle that move now.
Thanks!

Respuesta 9:
Anthony Ferrer
@AIM_Game

Wife and son provided photo!
Rule might be implicit, but upon re-reading it I maintain that it is not explicit.
It appears you placed the bridge there because you felt the tile was not a legal placement given you were placing a field against the road. But by placing the bridge you made an illegal placement on the opposite side of the tile - a road/bridge against a field.

Sounds good to me. If you both have the same number of farmers in that field, you both score the full number of points for that field, which indeed in the case of a field that bordered 9 complete cities would be 27. Happy gaming!

EDIT: Ah, didn't see the image before posting. If I'm not missing something, I think there are only 8 cities bordering the field for 24 points - the complete city furthest to the top right isn't in the field (the two adjoining cities to its left block access to it, although I admit that they don't look like they do in that picture).

Just to make sure: you can't place more than one meeple on the same field (whether your own or opponents'). You can place a meeple on a different field and then connect the fields.

Respuesta 4:
Ah! Of course, thank you! As those 3 cities join at the corners they are blocking access.

Thanks. I think I played my red farmer before the city in the middle (directly below the yellow farmer) was complete so at the time it was not obvious the fields were connected. I hope this was correct?

Respuesta 6:
Yes.

Since you have placed in a different farm, it's a legal move. Later in the game, it's possible to connect two existing farms, which seems that's what have happened.



Tema 124: Who places the lake tile of the river?
Pregunta:
Does a player actually spend an action to place the lake tile at the end of the river?

Or is that tile just put there?

It's a great place for a farm.

Couldn’t agree more. There is always a nice farm which wraps around end of river. It such a problem that with River II they put a city at the end of the river to try and prevent this.

As early as 2004 the Carcassonne: GQ Promo Tiles ran a road up to the river to split the farm.

Tema 125: Messages Expansion - Conflicting rules in CAR and official rulebook?
Pregunta:
I'm trying out this overly complicated Mini expansion - The Messages.

I'm having problems understanding tile #8

The official rules that came in the big box 6 I have say

"8) Score a Meeple and return it to your supply
Choose a feature with one of your meeples on it, and score it as you would during final scoring. However, even if other players have control of the feature, only you score points, though you may choose not to. Then, return your meeple that was on that feature to your supply"

But the Carcassonne Standard Complete Annotated Rules state

"(8.) Score a follower and remove it from the board: The player chooses
one of his or her followers in play. If the player has the majority in the
feature where the selected follower stands, he or she scores that feature
(only for himself or herself) as if it were the end of the game. The player
then puts the chosen follower back in his or her supply.426 427"

So If I have a knight in a city and my opponent has 2 knights, can I still score it or not? I've included a picture here (me being yellow)to show the scenario

Respuesta 1:
Those two quotes sound like they agree to me - yellow doesn't get any points.

The first quote says "score it as you would in final scoring" - ok then, 17 for black, 0 for yellow - "except only you get points" - ah, ok then, 0 for yellow.

Respuesta 2:
I agree with PenumbraPenguin, but just to clarify, there are a few things going on here with your rules sources. If you are using the last edition of the CAR PDF, then note that those rules were for the earlier edition of the game and may not reflect changes that Hans im Gluck has since made in their new-art edition. That being said, the CAR is based on a translated version of the German rules, which are officially more correct than the often poorly-translated versions of those rules into English by various publishers (Rio Grande Games or Z-Man Games).

In your case, you are using the newest Z-Man version, but there still may be a few inconsistencies with the official German rules. I would default to the version here: http://wikicarpedia.com/index.php/The_Messages, which now acts as the successor to the original CAR (the original and second author of the CAR have abandoned the project and a Wiki version was deemed the best alternative going forward). There are many FAQs addressed at the bottom of the page that may clarify your questions, one of which reads: "The ZMG rules allowed the active player to score a feature even without having the majority. This may be due to a mistranslation of the German rules." In other words, your interpretation of the Big Box 6 rules are wrong due to Z-Man being unclear in its translation.

Respuesta 3:
Big Box 6 (BB6)does appear to, at least imply, that I can score points even if I don't have control.
Quote:
However, even if other players have control of the feature, only you score points, though you may choose not to.
If I was reading both this would definitely be a difference, for me at least.

Of course you could always play however you wish, except for tournaments of course. BB6 does seem to have an extra bonus which is nice allowing you to score even if you're not in control of areas.

Respuesta 4:
That wiki is really nice. I had not seen that before. I'm going to try this out.

I didn't see a way to format the page for print, so I guess you just click your expansions and print? Is that right?

Respuesta 5:
Quote:
Choose a feature with one of your meeples on it, and score it as you would during final scoring. However, even if other players have control of the feature, only you score points, though you may choose not to.
It's definitely ambiguous, but can be squared with the CAR if the second sentence was meant to refer to joint/shared control (equal numbers of knights).

My experience has been after playing over 130 games of Carcassonne, assuming you're playing with only the base set, just about the only tile that ever causes this problem is the single all city tile. And more often than not, only if its drawn early in the game, when there are not several unfinished cities to attach it to. I think I've seen it occur about 3 times. So something like on average a 1% chance.

placement (and all players agree), the player discards the tile
from the game (into the box) and draws another tile to place.

Respuesta 13:
We play the game a long tim ebut now I finally remembered to ask this question here In those cases does "legally" means the possibility to place it to an opponent's "territory"? Let's say I draw the "all city" card and I don't have city in progress or there isn't a "no man's" city on the game plan and the only place where I could place it, is opponent's city - do I have to place it there or I can return it? Based on the official rules I think I should but I never want of course...

Respuesta 14:
There is no "my", "your", or "their" territory in Carcassonne. It is very valid to add to a feature claimed by someone else, as that's the only way to "worm yourself" to share scoring features (i.e. you place a tile which connects a feature claimed by you to the same feature claimed by someone else).

Legally means that there is no place where you would be able to place the tile so that it follows the rules of matching all existing shared edges and having at least one shared edge.

It is pretty rare to not be able to place a tile legally - I think in all out bi-weekly plays after the turn of the century this happened once.

Pregunta:
question

Respuesta 1:
Daniel Dukai
@danieldukai
question
Yes. You only place one meeple. But many can be scored, even when it is not your turn. Scoring is based on completion of a feature and not tied to a turn.

Respuesta 2:
If you mean you finish a feature (like a city) and it’s got multiple Meeples on it then no. If you mean you place a tile (say a tile with a road and a city on it and it finishes two features both of which have a Meeple on then yes.

Respuesta 3:
You cannot place more than one meeple to claim things at the end of your turn. So if two unclaimed roads are completed by you lying your tile on your turn, you have to pick one. If more than one feature is completed by the laying of one tile and these have meeples on them, then you score all completed features which do have a meeple on them including in principle one you placed on your turn on the tile you placed on your turn.

Respuesta 4:
You can think that all completed features are scored in the last step of the turn. Completed features that have meeples give points to the respective players and the meeples are returned to their owners.

1. Draw a tile.
2. Place a tile.
3. Optionally place a meeple.

More. You might not have to place a meeple; you might not even have a legal place to play one. Of course you're scoring meeples that have been placed on earlier turns.

You could place one tile that completes nine things: one for each edge of the tile and/or up to eight cloisters (if that many are in play), which would be a tile away including diagonally. IIRC, the base game has eight meeples, plus I&C(?) has the 2x meeple.

The easiest example is the + crossroads tile, which could complete four roads. It could be surrounded by eight cloisters. A couple three way crossroads and a city tiles exist, too; you couldn't complete a cloister on the city side, but you could complete the city.

If you were playing with the builder, that might let you complete one more thing on a single turn, placing two meeples in the turn.

Completing nine things is something not likely to happen in a real game, but I have seen two cloisters complete simultaneously, along with the completion(s) from the placed tile.

Hello there guys,

I just bought the Abbey and the Mayor expansion, and I experimented a bit with the tiles and managed to get myself into an interesting situation.



Let's asaume all 3 cities are finished. There is a corner where are 3 different cities touch each other, right next to the red piece. Does the red player scores 6 or 9 points in this case? (I know it's a mayor piece, but I didn't had the base game with me at the moment when I took the picture.)

Thank you in advance.

Respuesta 1:
As far as I can see the field is only next to two of the towns, so the framer would only score 6 points. Corners does not touch corners, otherwise you could argue that the cities all touch each other, and would thus be one big city.

Here is what you do in the base game:

3. Put a meeple on a feature that does not have any other meeple in it.
Or don't put a meeple on anything and then go to step 4.

The key thing here is understand that if you choose to deploy a meeple must be on the tile you just played (with exception of some expansion effects). That mechanism avoid you scoring illegal stuff. EDIT: So, in other words, any "unclaimed" feature beyond the turn of a player is not available for him, being able to complete and score during his own turn (respecting the other base meeple deploying rules).

Or don't put a meeple on anything and then go to step 4.

Respuesta 6:
The answers above leave a little room for misinterpretation so borrowing from them:

1. Draw a tile. Show the tile to other players so they may "advise" you. (You may also decide to always keep a tile in hand so you can think about its placement in your next turn. This does not change when the game ends: when the last tile is placed. Official variant, at least at one time: keep 3 tiles in hand; pick one to show and play.)

2. Place that tile and make sure all sides of this tile match up with any tiles it will touch when placed. (It must match grass to grass, city to city, road to road.) It is rarely possible that a tile cannot be placed; if so, discard the tile and end your turn.

3. You may put one meeple on one feature (city, road, cloister, field) of the tile you placed that does not have any other meeple on the feature in any connected tile(s). (Tiles do not connect diagonally. Some expansions allow placement of non-meeples like the builder or pig when a meeple connot be placed.) You may place a meeple on a feature (city, road, cloister) that you completed with this turn's tile in step 2, and score it immediately in step 4.
-- Or don't put a meeple on anything and then go to step 4.

4. Score any completed features on any tiles and return those meeples to their owners that were part of that scoring. Several features may score after one placement, however farms are never completed until end of game even if they are completely bounded. For example, you could place a tile that finished a city and a road; though you might not be able to place a meeple, the city and road are still scored, independently, possibly only for an opponent or opponents. Or you might place a road that connects two dead end roads, completing them as one road. The returned meeples may not be placed on your turn.

Rules:

Respuesta 7:
Thank you for the explanation everybody! Somehow I missed the part where you can only place a meeple on the tile you just played.

One additional question. If I complete an unclaimed city (or road), I can place a meeple in it and remove it to score at the same turn, right?

Respuesta 8:
Yes, everyone gets their meeples back immediately in the following scoring step from all of the completed features. But you need have a meeple to place to gain the points.

Tema 130: Score incomplete cloister then use portal to score it again?
Pregunta:
This happened to me a few days ago.

– ([n+1]-th turn) place a tile with magic portal + put an Abbot again on that incomplete cloister
– ([n+2]-th turn) take an Abbot back again and score the cloister again?

The summary logic of rules seems to allow that:
1) While not putting a meeple, I can take back an Abbot.
2) When placing a tile with magic portal, I can put a meeple/Abbot/… on any tile (but not on occupied or complete object, "even it it was not scored") ← this rule doesn't say anything about not putting on a scored but incomplete object.

Tema 135: Earning points for a finished element without a meeple?
Pregunta:
We have recently argued if you gained points for an finished element even if you haven’t placed a meeple in it. The problem occurred when Player A finished 2 roads that weren’t controlled by any other player. Does Player A gain the points given from both roads? Or does Player A only receive points for the element where they their meeple?
Any help is something!

Respuesta 1:
Only features with meeples score points. Not sure why that's even a question

Respuesta 2:
The order is:
1. Place tile.
2. Place meeple (if you have one and want to place one).
3. Score completed features, giving the meeples back.

If there is no meeple on a feature, it doesn't score for anyone.

You need to have a meeple to place to get the points and get the meeple back.

Respuesta 3:
As long as player A still has free meeples, they don't need to have any meeples on the feature before laying the tile to score it. Imagine it like this: lay a tile, put a meeple on, score, take the meeple off.

But if they finish 2 roads with the same tile and none of these roads have any meeples on them - they can only score one of those.

Respuesta 4:
And to be pedantic, You have to have an available meeple to place before you score anything. In other words if you place a tile that finished both a city and a road you need to place a meeple before you score anything.

If you do not have a meeple to place you can not score anything that does not have a meeple on it already.

Respuesta 5:
Placing meeples, not just building features, is the specific mechanic that allows you to score. Without the meeples, it would just be a team puzzle with no scoring.

Perhaps I was unclear.
The steps are:
You place a meeple (optional)
Then you score any completed features.

The point being that you can't take a meeple off of a completed feature and place it on a newly completed feature.

For example, if you place a tile that completes a city that you have a meeple on and a road that is unclaimed. You have the option to claim the road if you have an available meeple. You then would score the road and the city. Some have thought you could take the meeple off of the city and then place it on the road. This is what is not allowed.

Tema 137: Carcassonne - Playing with Bridges, Castles and Bazaars + Traders and Builders
Pregunta:
Hi everyone,

Yesterday I was playing with my wife and we got stuck using the expansions mentioned above. It was may turn and I draw a bazaar tile. Since there were only two players, we decided to, instead of doing the auction, let each player choose one of two tiles, picked up by me.

She has chosen first, placing her tile normally. Then I placed my tile in a city with a builder, scoring the city. Hence the question: since there was a builder in that city, could I draw another tile (and doing such I would draw the third tile in my turn)?

I thought it was ok. She didn't.

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
In the future, you might get a quicker answer in the Carcassonne-specific forums. Also, take a look at the Carcassonne Complete Annotated Rules, which combine all the expansions into a single document.

According to footnote 287 on page 94 of the Complete Annotated Rules, you do get the extra turn if your auctioned tile triggers your builder.

Respuesta 2:
Thank you very much Scott! And sorry for the mistake.

Respuesta 3:

That's not correct - unless it's been changed in a recent edition.

The builder is activated whenever you extend the road or city it's on, whether or not you completed that feature.

Andrew Roberts
@Storgendibal
That’s what I thought, so I checked Carcassonne Annotated Rules and it was changed, some time ago.
Are you sure the actual rule was changed, or just the wording?

There was a change some time ago because of the Abbey: it used to say the builder was activated when the feature is extended or completed, now it just says extended. But that's because there was originally no way to complete a feature without extending it, but the Abbey does just that.

But I don't think the intention of the rules has changed at all. After all, if you add a piece to a city that completes it, you are still extending that city, you're just completing it as well.

Unless there's been another change since then.

Respuesta 7:
That interpretation makes sense to me: you can complete whilst also extending (or can complete by not extending with the Abbey) and so the word change in rules might be to ensure the feature is primarily added to.

I actually play that if you complete and extend then you do get an extra go as I hadn’t picked up the change in rules (I have the 2005 version with early Builder expansion too).

As I only play in my family, house rules are what we use anyways!

Respuesta 8:
I was taught the game by someone & never checked that rule about the builder & finished features. Because of this discussion, I went back & checked both my old rule book (from an older big box) & my new rule book (from a big box recent enough to be the new art). In each case, it indicates that the builder is removed when the feature (city or road) is completed, but that it goes back to the supply & therefore can be placed on the second tile in your double turn as long as there is a meeple already in that other feature. Based on that, the interpretation I was originally taught that finishing a feature negates the builder is incorrect. A builder activates a second turn even if the feature was finished in the first turn.

Respuesta 9:
Will
@Broadstorm
... A builder activates a second turn even if the feature was finished in the first turn.
Correct, IF the feature was also extended. In the case of the Abbey essentially truncating the feature while also completing it, then an extra Builder turn is not triggered. You must in some way extend the feature in order to trigger the extra Builder turn.

I haven't played with the abbey, but yes, the feature with the builder must be extended (and by the player who has the builder on the feature) to activate the additional turn.

We just recently got expansion 8, so we're still getting used to the rules for it.

If on your turn you pull a tile with a bazaar and place it in your city with a builder (extending the city), should you take your second turn before or after the bazaar auction?

We went with after, but found things got very messy: it was a 3 player game and the bazaar player "banked" their second turn until after the auction, but then the tile they got from the auction also extended the city, giving them ANOTHER builder turn to take AND they were the third player to play their auctioned tile, so they ended up placing three tiles in a row (the tile they got from the auction, the tile they got for extending the buildered city with it, and the "banked" builder tile).

According to the CAR  (bottom of p93) in this case you:

1. place the bazaar tile
2. draw the tiles for the auction face down
3. perform your builder turn
4. then hold the auction.

Also, if anyone can extend their builder feature with the tile they win in the auction, they place the tile from the auction first, place & score meeples, then take their builder turn immediately.

And although a bazaar tile drawn for the auction will not trigger a new auction, any bazaar tile drawn during a builder turn will do so! The new auction will happen once everyone has placed their auction tile and had their builder turn.

This is why I never use the bazaars.

No the tree is correct so it can end all 3 segments of the road. I think the error was that it is not clear which of the two segments (left or right) that is affected by the inn. I don't recall the official word but I'd play it as the right one since that is where the building in.

I find this tile to be vaguely frustrating. So apparently a tree can end a road (hmm...), making it 3 roads. And yet 2 of the 3 are affected by the inn, even though it's right next to one of them.

Tema 139: Scoring differences between editions ( farmers)
Pregunta:
I have two editions of Carcassonne, copyright 2000 ( in regular box) and
2011 (in Meeple shaped box). Both are Rio Grande & Hans im Gluck.

The 2000 rulebook states that
1. Farmers earn four points per completed city
2. If ..” several farms …supply a city … the player with the most farmers in the farms supplying the city earns the four points..”
3. In the case of a tie for “most farmers”, all tied players earn the four points ( ie “generous ties” applies..)

However, the 2011 rulebook states :
“.. for each city a farm supplies, the player who deployed the most farmer(s) in the farm earns three points…if players tie with the most farmers, each scores three points..”

I think this should read “…the most farmer(s) in the most farm(s)…[ earns three points] ”

Is there a good reason for this discrepancy ?

Do BOTH versions mean : "... the most farmers supplying the city earn ALL the points.." ?

Respuesta 1:
My understanding is that the majority holder of a farm gets all the points for each city it supplies. If the number of farmers in that farm is tied, all the stake holders get all the points. In my edition that is three points per city, but I am aware different editions have different point structures. Another variance I have seen is how the big meeple counts. 1.5 or 2

It is also possible for multiple farms to supply a single city. In which case, each farm is scored separately. So I could get 6 or more points for farms from a single city. I have seen two farms. More is feasible but unlikely.

Respuesta 2:
Farmers compete for most just as they would any other feature. The farm is a field as far as you can trace it. Roads, cities & rivers will be a border to the field. Easier to see on the recent digital version.

Whoever has most farmers for a field gains 3pts per city that the field touches.

Respuesta 3:
Mr. Grace
@Capn Hook
Is there a good reason for this discrepancy ?
The rules have changed.

Respuesta 4:
These are genuinely different sets of rules. First edition rules have you score farms per city - for each completed city, someone gets 4 points, depending on who has the most farmers on adjacent farms. Third edition rules have you score farms per farm - for each farm, someone gets 3n points, where n is the number of adjacent complete cities.

The two rule sets play quite similarly with regard to the early game and fighting for the important farms. They do change the opportunities available in the last few turns where you might consider taking a very small farm.

I like first edition rules more, but only because I think it's nice that not all features are scored in the same way. It's just a matter of taste.

Some expansions (like the barn) won't work with first edition rules.

For completeness, there's also a difference in the scoring of two-tile cities - in first edition, these are two points, and in third edition, four points. I like the first edition rule here too, because it incentivises building cities of at least three tiles, rather than just building a whole lot of two-tile cities.

You might be wondering what happened to second edition. I don't know the details, I think it's more similar to third than to first.

Respuesta 5:
There are a few threads, some quite old, about the various different farmer scoring rules. Depending on which edition from which country you look at, there have been "differences".

Simply the rules changed. You choose if you want to play with the first rules or with the current rules. Personally, I like both, although it is true that the first rules focused the game too much on the farms, giving them excessive prominence. Later with these modifications a more balanced game has been achieved.

Why wouldn't the barn expansion work with the old rules? You simple score barns immediately based on the expansion's rules (3-points), and any farms left for scoring at the end of the game would be scored based on the 1st edition 4-point rule.

So at the end of the game, you score barns by field and farmers by city? That sounds pretty strange to me, but if it's fun, go for it!

You'll have a few questions to resolve, like how to score a city with two adjacent farms, one of which has a barn.

The barn also doesn't really work like it's supposed to here, because it's supposed to close out a farm, which makes a bit less sense if you're not scoring farmers by farms.

Also, if coming from an older edition, it might be wise to see what all the differences are between editions and publishers.

a) Recallable meeple, instead of playing a meeple on your turn you may score one of your metal meeples as if it were the end game and return him to your supply. Note, if his feature is controlled by someone else, you would score nothing.

b) Small meeples. On your turn, instead of playing a meeple you may exchange one of your meeples for two metal meeples. The metal meeples are small and loose when tied with another team, but you can have more of them.

c) Rock, paper, scissors meeple. The metal meeple when placed on a feature supports an adjacent feature when calculating domination.
City meeple supports road (road must end in the city)
Road meeple supports farm
Farm meeple supports city

Note the support only counts when the points are given out. The road meeple must still be on the board at the end of the game to help a farm.

Respuesta 3:
d) Explorer. When the metal meeple is on the map, he can be traded in for an ability to sort through tiles for your next draw. You draw as many tiles as he is currently worth in endgame points. You then can play one and remix the unchosen tiles back into the supply. If he is worth zero, you can still trade him in and choose one tile. You may score him as normal when appropriate, too.

Respuesta 4:
Some sort of scary "Terminator" Meeple? (name subject to change...):
People can't place tiles, or meeples, adjacent (in the 3x3 grid) to your metal meeple.

It could cause some issues in the beginning of the game so maybe play with the river fully extended before terminators are allowed.

Yes it counts. You get a point for the cloister itself, plus one point for each additional adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) tile, to a maximum of 9.

Tema 143: Legal first move?
Pregunta:
Let's say the top tile was the first. Is the tile below it a legal move? One of our players says the second tile must continue the road if possible. I tend to disagree since if you drew a city/field tile, you'd have to use the field part to "continue the landscape". So does the above continue the landscape enough or must I continue the road?

So in general the question is do fields always count as continuing even if there are other more prominent part of the tile (roads or cities) that could continue the landscape in a more obvious way?

Respuesta 1:
It is legal. You can connect the new tile however you want so long as the edges match.

But you're supposed to start with the "Start Tile", that has a different back and has a city segment as well as a road on it.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, you're right. The field is a feature that can be continued, equal to roads or cities. Roads or cities are not "more important" than farms. (In fact, you ignore farms at your peril...)

The only requirements are that the 2nd tile must share a side with the 1st tile, and that side must match. Your placement fits both requirements.

But you're supposed to start with the "Start Tile", that has a different back and has a city segment as well as a road on it.
True. I didn't dig it up for the picture. I used this just to illustrate the point. Although it does make my comment about the city/field tile moot.

Respuesta 5:
Your friend is thinking of the River expansion. When you use that expansion, the river tiles must be placed so as to continue the river (and also it can't double back on itself).

Respuesta 6:
The field is a feature that can be continued, equal to roads or cities Wow, we've been playing wrong...Never thought that fields would be a continued feature also! Thanks for the 'heads-up'!



Tema 144: How to score this road? Every part or every tile?
Pregunta:
I am confused. Do i must score 6 or 7 points? Because the road is made of 6 tiles but it has 7 parts...

Respuesta 1:
Both roads and cities are scored per tile. (Not per road or city segments.)

Yes, that would make it 6 points and not 7

I am confused. Do i must score 6 or 7 points? Because the road is made of 6 tiles but it has 7 parts...:what:
Quoting from English rules, recent Z-Man rules are brief but have emphasis in bold.

When scoring a road, each tile of that road grants you 1 point.


Previous publisher Rio Grande Games made the distinction about separate segments more distinctly in the last phrase here.

The player who has a thief on a completed road scores one
point for each tile in the completed road (count the
number of tiles; separate segments on a tile count just
once).

Tema 145: Placing Farmers on Monasteries

Hi Folks!

Just discovered Carcassonne recently (yes, I've been on the Moon for 19 years!) and while I can find answers to most questions I've encountered so far, something came up today which has stumped me as the rules aren't very clear:

Can you place a Farmer on a Monastery tile instead of a Monk?

Can you place a Farmer on a Monastery tile instead of a Monk?

Many thanks for your time!
Yes, you can. As a common tile, they have 2, 3 or 4 kinds of segments. Monastery + Farm, Monastery + Farm + Road, Monastery + Farm + Road + City. The thing is that you must choose place a meeple on one or neither of them.

Respuesta 3:
Thanks for that, yes thinking logically about it, it makes sense when you take into consideration the Monastery with the piece of road on it. I'd forgotten about that one, as the tile in question was just the plain Monastery one.



Tema 146: Carcassonne and playing the Abbot
Pregunta:
Advice on this scenario please.

(1) my abbot is sitting on an incomplete garden.
(2) when it is my turn, I pick up another garden tile
(or a monastery - it matters not which it is)

????
(A) Am I allowed to pick up the abbot and score the "old" garden and place the abbot instantly on the "new" garden
or
(B) am I never allowed to instantly play my abbot after picking him up - but may only hold him in my hand for subsequent use

Respuesta 1:
B - you can either place a meeple on your turn, or pick up the abbot meeple, but not both.

Respuesta 2:
dsco bee is right.

Plus you never pick then place a meeple. Rather it is always the other way round. You place your tile placing a meeple if you have one. Then score and pick up your meeple. This is important when you're out of meeples as placing comes before picking one up.

i.e. you can't pick one up from scoring and immediately reuse it.

Respuesta 3:
rule of thumb,

1) place a tile
2) may place a meeple - if you don't place a meeple, then you may pick up Abbot or move Fairy.. (you will only affect one meeple of any kind in this step)
3) Score features - returning all meeples from any completed features to supply - ends turn

Respuesta 4:
From the rulebook:

Quote:
The abbot also has another special ability. On your turn
during action 2 (Placing a meeple), if you decide not to
place a meeple, you are allowed to take back your abbot.

Respuesta 5:
When you draw a volcano, you have to place the Dragon on it, so you cannot put any follower… but – officially – you can move Fairy… but, hm, can you take an Abbot back from an incomplete cloister/garden? Not specified in rulebook, nor in CAR.

Respuesta 6:
I would say yes. I think the reason you can't put a follower on the volcano tile is because the dragon would immediately eat it, not because placing the dragon counts as the "placing a follower" part of your turn.

Respuesta 7:
That does make sense, thank you.



Tema 147: Using the meeple you've just gotten back
Pregunta:
This has come up several times in my games.
When a player who has no available meeples left draws a tile which enables him/her to complete a feature (thereby getting a meeple back), can he/she use that meeple to claim a new feature on the tile they've just drawn?
So far, we've ruled against this, as the rules state that you first place a tile, then place a meeple, and only then score points (and get your meeples back). Were we doing it right?

Thanks in advance.

Respuesta 1:
Your interpretation is correct. By the time you get your follower back, the opportunity to place them has passed.

Respuesta 2:
Thank you, Frederic!

Respuesta 3:
No he cannot use it to claim a new feature.

The round is played in the following order :
1) Place a tile
2) Claim an unoccupied feature on the newly placed tile
3) Score any completed feature, taking back your meeple

So if you get a meeple back from step 3, you cannot use it in step 2

I hope it makes things clearer.

Respuesta 5:

Respuesta 6:
Dumb follow-up / related question. Suppose there is an unoccupied city tile on the board. I place a tile that completes the city. If the rule is "place tile, place meeple, score" then I can play that tile, place my meeple on my just played tile, and immediately score it. Is that correct?

Tema 148: Farmers share farm
Pregunta:
I need to clarify this:

You can put two farmers in the same farm?

For example:

In your first turn you place a farmer, in your second turn place a second farmer next to the other farmer played in you first turn; in other words, can you place the second farmer directly in the farm of other of your farmers or only in a indirectly way where the pieces can join the two farms?

Respuesta 1:
You can only place one meeple on any one feature. and once there is a meeple on a feature, no one else can place one there either.

Only one per farm, road or city.
It is possible that separate farms/cities/roads with their own meeple can join up to become one large farm/city/road with multiple meeples. In which case the person with the majority takes all the points. Second place gets nothing. If there is a tie, all tied players get ALL the points. The number of meeples on a feature only count to determine majority. You don't get twice the points if you have two meeples there.

Respuesta 2:
No you can never place a meeple on a feature that already has a meeple (or more than one), inlcuding farms. You can only add meeples to a farm indirectly, by joining two farms.

Respuesta 3:
I agree with the responders, with two expansion exceptions: the Pig and the Barn. The Pig can ONLY go on a field with your own meeple. And the barn can abut a field with any farmers (as long as it is at a 4 way intersection of grass).

I think it is pretty safe to assume the OP only has the base game (or maybe a big box). He is certainly just starting out. and within the rules, meeples are meeples. Builders (and pigs!) are not referred to as meeples. At least not in the version I have.

Helping, I hope, in drawing attention to potential confusion. A player generally acquainted with euro games might know the generic term meeple and use it to refer to the figures that come in the box. The OP, being an apparent beginner to Carcassonne, would likely benefit in being aware that there is a difference in the meeples in the game. In Carcassonne, as we know, "meeple" means something specific. The rulebook however does not use the capital M when referring to the playing piece but rather the lower case m, allowing a potential for it to be interpreted as a generic piece. That could be confusing to a beginner.

You draw the depicted tile with three road segments starting from a village. You must place it in such a way that it continues the existing landscape (the tiles already in play).



Your example does not continue anything.


Older rules from publisher Rio Grande spelled it out in more detail, that tiles must be edge-to-edge.

•The new tile (with red borders in the examples) must be placed with at least one edge adjacent and abutting
one previously placed tile. The new tile may not simply be placed corner to corner with a previous tile.

No, you can only place 1 meeple per turn, only on the tile you just placed, and only if that feature is not yet claimed.

The usual trick is to place a tile that is not (yet) connected to the feature you want, and put a meeple on the corresponding part of your tile. Then on a later turn, place another tile to connect the features. This can get 2 (or more) of your own meeples into one feature.

And some expansions have more variants on edge combinations that makes it easier to keep your thing split from other players, like the 4 dead end city tile with a field in the middle or 'witch hat' single city tiles that splits fields from Inns and Cathedrals.

Wooden bridges from the expansion don't split fields. This rule is written in a leaflet from the Bridges… expansion itself (Croatian) .

Farme i gradovi pod mostovima nisu razdijeljeni. → The farms and cities under the bridges are not divided.

Drawn bridges (drawn on tiles) do split fields. This rule is written in a leaflet from Traders and Builders expansion (English) .

The fields are separated by the bridge.



Tema 154: Neighbouring monasteries with meeple on one
Pregunta:
Hello Everyone, (first post on BGG)
we had an interesting setup today, that confused us a bit. We had an area of fields/roads etc, fully filed, with only one "hole" in the middle. Next to the hole, there was a monastery. Then someone pulled an other monastery. As confirmed on other threads, I understand that it is okay, to place a monastery next to an other one, and immediately score (9 points) with it.

Now the problem was that the monastery next to the hole already had a meeple on it. We weren't sure, whether it's okay to place a meeple on a monastery, next to a monastery with a meeple. If it was a road, this would be against the rules, even withe a field. But the monasteries are not linked themselves, they are surrounded.

I have come across this issue today.

Tema 157: Placing and scoring an abbot OR Is the abbot a meeple?
Pregunta:
My family has been playing Carcassonne for a few weeks and we have had trouble agreeing on the the interpretation of a rule about scoring the abbot.

Can you place the abbot and score the abbot on the same turn?

The rules about the abbot state "2. Placing a meeple OR your abbot" which leads us to believe that an abbot is not a meeple.

The rules also say "On your turn during action 2 (Placing a meeple), if you decide not to place a meeple, you are allowed to take back your abbot."

The real question is... Is the abbot a meeple? If it is a meeple, then you cannot remove it on the same turn because you placed a meeple. If it is not a meeple, then you can remove it because you placed an abbot, not a meeple.

I think I know the intent of the rules but we (family) decided to come to the forum for input. Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
Interesting, I have always interpreted playing the Abbott as being like placing a meeple and so you would not be able to remove it the turn you play it. I think that is the intent of the rule.

However, I do see your point that it refers to the Abbott as a separate non-meeple piece and so a literal reading of this would suggest you can remove it the turn you played it. Checked the rest of the rules and nothing suggested that you could not perform both action on one turn either, so now I'm not positive either.

Respuesta 2:
You may not place an abbot and remove it in the same turn except in the extremely unlikely circumstance that the garden or monastery would be completed in that same turn (i.e. you’ve filled in the middle of a 3x3 set of tiles with a garden or monastery tile), in which case it would act the same as any other meeple - so there’d be no advantage in noticing this, unless your abbot was your last remaining meeple.

(Note that you may not delay taking any meeple back for a completed feature, including the abbot).

Respuesta 3:
You place a tile,
Then put down OR pick up 1 meeple (whether of any type normal/big/abbot/mayor/builder/pig/fairy/etc)
Then resolve special things like moving the dragon, eat fruit..
Finally you check for scoring features and get back those meeples and points

No, this isn’t right. You can’t take back ordinary meeples whenever you feel like it. Nor can you take back a pig, for example. Each meeple type has its own rules for placement, which might be “as normal” or might be be otherwise.

Respuesta 5:
I expect the post you're replying to intended "this is the point in time at which you place or retrieve a meeple if you are allowed, and you can't take both options"

Respuesta 6:
Yes, probably, but you can see where confusion would arise, if someone already isn’t certain of the placement rules.

Respuesta 7:
Welcome to BGG, Lee!

And also, welcome to the unfortunate rules of Carcassonne. They are not exactly crystal clear, at least in English, unfortunately. Until there's an official word (which I would not ever expect), you'll have to house rule, or play like the licensed apps play.

The apps do not let you place and pick up an Abbot in the same turn.

(Another omission from the rules is that they do not say that rivers are edges of fields. Fascinating, no?)

Respuesta 8:
Thanks for the input everyone!

I agree that the intent of the rule is to not allow placing and removing the abbot on a partially completed area on the same turn. I'll have to see if I can talk the family into changing the way we play.

What that means is it can’t turn in the same direction on two tiles in a row - i.e. it can’t turn immediately back on itself, because that is fairly likely to create a situation where you can’t legally place any more tiles.

Think about driving.

You're on 10th street. You jerk the wheel around to the left until you're going the opposite direction on 10th street. That's a u-turn.

Now you're on 10th street, you turn left on 1st avenue, go one block and turn left on 9th street. That's not a u-turn.

This is exactly the same as in English: When you place, you can place a normal meeple or an Abbot. They also appear to be the same regarding the lack of clarification about whether you can pick up an Abbot if you have placed it that same turn. It roughly says "if you not placed a meeple in Aktion 2" but does not say "if you have not placed a meeple or abbot"... which is the original question.

Good to know. Both the current Android one by Asmodee Digital and the previous one by Exozet make the river take alternate turns.

Respuesta 20:
Huh. Seems like an odd implementation, especially by Asmodee...

Respuesta 21:
Wow, I hadn't realized there were so many gray areas in the rules for Carcassonne. I always assumed rivers had to alternate turn directions, but apparently the rules example illustrates otherwise. As for the original question, the convention used in the rulebook is that the abbot is NOT considered a meeple, but that being said, I think the intention is for players NOT to be allowed to just place and pick up in the same turn. I could be totally wrong, but it just seems totally broken to be able to pick up 2 garden tiles back to back for a quick 15 points without any commitment, while every other meeple is bound to their construction project until completion. I need to reread the rules though to see if it changes my mind.

Just to make sure I'm clear: one player gave the tile they had to another player? That is totally against the rules.

The tile you draw is yours. There's no trading or giving away of tiles or anything else. Player can choose to cooperate, of course, but that's all, and any agreement they make is not binding in any way).

Well, technically, she can place the tile wherever she wants and she can ask the other player where she should place it without actually giving it to her.

Respuesta 6:
Am I the only one that really can't understand the question? "Gave" the tile, how does that even happen?

I don't understand your question. What do you think kingmaking is?

Respuesta 8:
Having been done so openly and blatently (per the report) then I have misgivings about calling it cheating. But if this is not behavior all players consented to then it certainly is insulting.

Respuesta 9:
If you mean that:
* Room mate A took their turn
* Room mate B encouraged Room mate A to put the tile in a specific place
* Room mate A either did so, or handed the tile to Room mate B to do so AS THEIR TURN

Then nothing against the rules happened. In fact nothing unfair happened. The game specifically says that each tile is supposed to be shown to the other players before being played, and that they can attempt to sway the decision. Complaining that the tile touched a second pair of hands is somehow cheating is rubbish: as long as the tile goes where A wants it to, the move is fair.

Further, if it's really that obvious that room mate A can't compete, and the only thing they can do is kingmake... that's the perils of thrashing someone in a game. In a multi way game, you're better off not doing that. Either help them keep up enough that they think they can win right to the end, or be nice enough to them that their kingmaking falls in your favour.

On the other hand, if your room mates always team up against you in 3 way games no matter what you do then stop playing with them, because they're being asses.

If, on the other hand, you mean that
* Room mate A drew a tile from the bag
* Room mate A did not place the tile as part of their go (by handing it to B)

Then yes, that's against the rules of the game.

I think the point might be that if you read the rules, there really shouldn't be any confusion over this. There's nothing that indicates anyone can pass tiles off to someone else. You play the tile you pick. I admit a curiosity as to what in the rules would make you believe this was possible? (And I'm not attempting to be condescending. I'd really like to know.)

From your post, I get the impression this was indeed intentional, i.e. the second scenario Saeviomage presented, not the first. If that's a correct interpretation, I would consider that just as much cheating as if she had done something wrong to help herself.

Respuesta 16:

@plezercruz

Pete (sees no difference there)
Kingmaking is making a sub-par move for yourself to benefit someone else. Usually happens when you see that you can't win no matter what, so instead to continue to play to win (which you can no more achieve), you play to make someone else to win (who might not have been the winner if you continued to play for yourself).


The most basic example would be:

Player 1 has 2 points
Player 2 has 5 points
Player 3 has 7 points

There are 3 cards left

Card #1 gives 4 points
Card #2 gives 2 points
Card #3 gives 1 point

Every player pick one of them and then it is the end of the game.

The obvious choice for Player 1 is to pick the card that gives the most points (Card #1) but even if he select it, he can't win (it would bring him to 6 points which is less than what Player 3 already have).

Kingmaking here would be Player 1 to pick Card #2, allowing Player 2 to pick Card #1, which would bring him to 9 points and Player 3 would get Card #3, giving him a final score of 8 points.

This is kingmaking because if Player 1 picks the card that would benefit him the most (Card #1), it would make Player 2 to pick Card #2, which brings him to 7 points which is less than Player 3 with Card #3 (final score of 8 points).

Respuesta 17:
Unfortunately most issues with kingmaking aren't that simple, nor involve just a simple, overt bit of math. It makes the point, but in many situations, you really do have to decide who you're going to help win because it's not going to make a difference to yourself.

But in this scenario, I think a response that's more directly related is that Sye would have won on his own had she not given the tile to the other player. That would not be a case of "making the other person win." She would not have "made him win" - but rather just made her own move and it just so happens he would have won. By giving the tile to someone else that so they gained enough points to win, she was directly helping that person to win and not even making her own move. Can you see the difference there, Pete?

The choice was "make person A win" vs "make person B win". It IS kingmaking either way. Someone who cannot win can decide the winner of the game.

Next time either make them think they can win right to the end, or pony up an appropriate bribe to make sure it's you who gets kingmade

Respuesta 19:
As others have stated, etiquette here dictates that you make the move which would benefit yourself most, regardless of who it will help.

This is such an ambiguous report that it's impossible to know what actually took place. From those words, how could anyone make a judgment on whether a rule was broken?

Perhaps the OP could rephrase the question with more clarity on the events of those last two turns?

Respuesta 21:
I think in reality kingmaking is always present to a degree. It may be one player wins the majority of times in that game or in games in general so people naturally will side with the underdog. This may be at some future date the favour will be returned.

I tend to win Acquire more than the rest of the group and I am not totally surprised if mergers are done to my disadvantage if all other things are roughly equal. It is perfectly understandable social move.

However not all games allow for a sort of graduated kingmaking and if essentially you are being picked on as a deliberate policy then your opponents are unworthy fo playing games.



Tema 159: 2 Questions ( TIle Placement / Specific Tile)
Pregunta:
Sorry, rules are not clear


1) I know diagonal and up/right/left/down are allowed, but what about tiles 1 full tile space between them and the last tile?


2) If this tile


is placed, and the edges are part of 1 city, not 2 different ones would that be counted as 2 points for this tile or 4 points (2 per each "edge") for this tile?

Respuesta 1:
1) Your question is not clear. But new tiles must be placed with at least one edge next to an existing tile on the table. You can't place tiles that are only connected at a corner (these are considered not connected in Carcassonne) and certainly not a empty space or more away.

2) The tile counts as one tile. Cities score 2 point per tile.

Respuesta 2:
I will also confirm point 2.
You score features per tile, not per segment.

Respuesta 3:
A new tile must touch at least one existing tile. It isn't required that it touch the most possible tiles.

If you have some tiles in configuration like:
  X
  X X X

Then the valid places for new tiles to be placed are the numbers:

  1
2 X 4 5
3 X X X 6
  7 8 9

Could that other thread be refering to the small Cathedrals in Germany  expansion, which does allow meeples to be added as bishops?

Back to Inns and Cathedrals... I don't know about Abbots (I'm old school), but to clarify the above points, a standard meeple can be placed on a cathedral tile, but it's just considered to be in the city: the meeple being on the cathedral tile doesn't modify its doubling effect in any way, and it's just another knight.

Good find. Even though they don't say it there, I read that as refering to the German Cathedrals (see entry 43 in the same GeekList ), which operate in a similar manner to the standard Cloister, in that you place a meeple on the feature and wait until things around it have been completed, rather than the far more common Cathedrals from Expansion 1, which only affect cities. I can't find a source for that interpretation, though.

The Carcassonne Annotated Rules  makes no mention of an exception to the placement rules for Abbots on Inns and Cathedrals 's Cathedrals. (It doesn't yet cover the German Cathedrals (not to be confused with the German Monasteries , which also features a different Abbot) so it doesn't help clarify for the other question.)

I think that it's fair to say that - unless you're playing with the German Cathedrals mini expansion - the Abbot is restricted to Cloisters and Gardens.

On the tile, yes, but not on the Cathedral itself. The Cathedral from I&C is a non-claimable element. It just serves as a multiplier (or negater if the city is incomplete). Of course you can claim the city. However, the Abbot cannot claim the city because an Abbot can only claim Monasteries (both original and "themed"), Shrines, Gardens, and German Cathedrals. Thus, since an Abbot can't claim a city and the Cathedral is a non-claimable feature, then the Abbot cannot claim anything on a Cathedral tile.

Thanks to all for the clarifications, think it’s clear now no Abbot in a non-German Cathedral.



Tema 161: Abbots, abbeys and shrines questions
Pregunta:
Hi
Please can someone help with the following questions, to confirm if we are playing correctly

1 can the abbot be used in the Abbey ? We play that it can, even though the abbot rules say garden and monastery only.

2 can the abbot be used in the shrine ? We play that it can't, as it seems to be against religion.

3 does the Abbey have a conflict challenge against an adjacent shrine,in the same way a monastery does ? We play that it doesn't, as the Abbey rules say it always fits.

4 can the Abbey be played after the tilebag is used up? We current play that it can, but are not convinced.

5 if you place a shrine in a complete hole (i.e. all 8 other tiles are there) but one of them is a monastery (already occupied), which becomes complete with the shrine, if you place a meeple on it, can both score? We currently avoid this as we don't know.

6 a shrine can't be played next to 2 monasteries, but what about next to 1 monastery and 1 Abbey ? Again we avoid this at present.

Many thanks in advance for any help with these

Mike

Respuesta 1:
1 The Abbey is considered a monastery so you can definitely place an abbot here.
2 Yes, you can play an abbot on a shrine. The rules for the shrine say they are played the same as a monastery, so all the rules involving monasteries also apply to shrines.
3 Yes, the abbey will cause a battle with the shrine. The adjacency rule applies here as well. If the adjacent shrine is already battling another monastery/abbey, then you can't place the abbey there...at least until the battle is over.
4 Yes, the rules allow for abbeys to be played at the end.
5 In this situation, since both shrine and monastery complete at the same time, they both score.
6 Since an Abbey is considered a monastery, a shrine can't be placed adjacent to both.

Respuesta 2:
Just curious which expansions are these? Shrines and Abbys?

Respuesta 3:
4 NO If the tile bag is empty, the game is over. You are going to score the points. The same rule is for "Half & Half" or "Castles in Germany"
(The rules of the base game say this too:
"When a player places the last (land) tile, the game ends after his turn.")
By the way: an Abbey needs a hole = 4 surrounding tiles to be placed.

Abbeys in "Expansion 5"
Shrines in "Expansion 6" or in "cult, siege & creativity" or in "shrines & heretics"
a) Abbot in "Carcassonne Version II"
b) Abbot in "Monasteries in Germany" or "Dutch Monasteries / De Kloosters"

7 Abbots can't battle others. (They are not heretic nor monk)
a) Abbots can be removed before completion. They score the value of the uncompleted building.
b) Abbots are scored in the end.

3 An Abbey is considered a monastery.
BUT The extra rule: "If the adjacent shrine is already battling another monastery/abbey, then you can't place the abbey there...at least until the battle is over." is only statet in english rules of "shrines & heretics" (these rules have an other fault: "A shrine must not be placed directly to one or more cloisters.")
It's not part of the rules "cult siege & creativity", "Expansion 6" nor the german rules "Kultstätten"
SO - You can place a cloister adjacent to as many other cloisters and to maximum one shrine. An already placed shrine can getting two surrounding cloisters, because the later placed cloister isn't surrounded by several shrines. (And you are allowed to battle with two monks against one heretic for example: placing the second cloister after placing the shrine.)

carcassonnecentral.com OR carcassonne-forum.de are also a good way for rule-questions.



Tema 162: Scoring Roads with Bazaars or Watchtowers
Pregunta:
Wondering about roads on bazaar or watchtower tiles. Does a road bisected by either a bazaar or watchtower actually score as two roads? Meaning that meeples can be placed on either segment and the bazaar or watchtower is a terminus.

Respuesta 1:
I would absolutely think so. This is consistent with all of the rest of the graphic design of the game. General rule of thumb is that if the roads look separated, they are unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Tema 163: The first river tile
Pregunta:
Does the first river tile score for a farm on both sides of the river?

Respuesta 1:
Yes. The field goes all the way around the tile. We stopped scoring fields when using the river because of this. It was just a huge advantage for the first player to just claim the field. We had one player who scored nearly 50 pts off just that one piece, effectively winning her the game before it ever began. Ofcourse the way around it is to lay lots of roads nearby, but depending how the river comes out it can lead to a massive field advantage.

Or you could, you know, invade their field with your own meep instead of letting them rack up points?

The mini expansion ( ) has a replacement first river tile that has a road.

In any case, I never use the river as it makes the start of the game too diffuse. I prefer starting from a single tile.

Respuesta 5:
ofcourse we tried to get in or cut the field, but with the river you can get a massive field going from that one tile and it makes it that much harder, if not impossible to close off. Just because I get a farmer in the field doesn't mean they don't get a second, and so forth and so forth.

The OP asked a question, I answered and gave my experiences of what can happen. We stopped playing river + fields because it just turned into a field battle most the time. Yes, other points are scored but it really came down to whoever controlled the central field would dominate end game scoring. We didn't enjoy it so we stopped playing fields.

The OP and his group can play how they wish, but itleast now the OP knows how it works.

You also don't have to build around the tiles other people have laid down. The map can get all sorts of crazy. My river comes with a road/bridge piece. It is a great way to break up any field that may be made by the start tile. So sometimes our games end up with a weird tail at one end or each player can build up their own little area and make their own massive field. To each their own.

Respuesta 8:
Yes, I know all of this. I know how to steal cities and fields...i'm quite good at it. I was just letting the OP know that sometimes, when using the river and if you get a stack that has all the open field features up front and the field breaking features on the bottom you can have a very large connected to that one single tile that ONE person has claimed as the opening move of the game. Sometimes it works out for them, sometimes not. But it happened enough for us that we stopped playing fields with the river.

House rule all you want, doesn't bother me. No, seriously, it doesn't, but you did say it was near impossible to block off that center field. We usually end up with a lot of "center" fields when playing with the river, thought maybe you were off on something. I also like to steal fields, especially massive ones and will plan it out to do so if I can (hoping I get the right pieces and not the ones others need or that they get mine). I also like screwing with people named Jeff. My son hates me for it.

I once played a game of Carcassonne with the river where everyone had something like four or five farmers on the central field and split the points.

Carc is excellent with 2 and still interesting with 3, but beyond that it's kind of a crapshoot. Four or more and you have to start making deliberate, overt alliances (which I guess is fine if that is your sort of thing, but it isn't mine).



Tema 164: 2 meeples on a road - scoring.
Pregunta:
In our current game two bits of road have joined to become one road, and there are two meeples of the same colour on that stretch. Once the road is completed how is it scored... does the player get two lots of points for the road or one lot of points. I can't see this clarified in the rules.

Help appreciated.. thanks!

Respuesta 1:
You only get one lot of points.

Meeples are used to determine who gets the points, not how many points are given. You'll get the same points whether you have 1 meeple or all of your meeples on a feature when you're the only one on it. If someone else is also on the same feature, then whoever has more gets the points. If you tie, then you both get the full points (they are not split).

Respuesta 2:
If there is 1 meeple of yours and 1 meeple of someone else that have started 2 separate roads, and then they have merged together, then you and your opponent get full points. If the total points for the road were 8 points, you would get 8 and your opponent would get 8.

If you had 1 meeple and your opponent had 2 meeples (excluding builder) then you would get 0 points and your opponent would get 8 points.

Would this also apply in an end game accounting? If one person has a meeple with 3 tiles and another player connects it to another road with say two tiles but it isnt a finished road at the end of the game, would both players (Since its even meeples) get 5 points?

Tema 165: River U-turn example in the new rules
Pregunta:
There has been a lot of discussion about the u-turn rule for the river. Does it ban two consecutive turns in the same direction or only two immediate consecutive turns in the same direction? I just noticed that the rules for the 2014 edition shows an example of a legal, non-immediate u-turn, while still giving the ambigious text.

https://images-cdn.zmangames.com/us-east-1/filer_public/14/a...

Respuesta 1:
You can take a U turn, actually we usually do. It just can't be immediate because you may (and probably will) not be able to place the next tile because it wont fit with the sides.

Sometimes it fits and it looks nice, so if the next player draws a piece and we see it would fit if the previous player wants he can change it to an immediate turn. (That's how we play).

Respuesta 2:
I agree, but some people seem to argue that you cannot make two consecutive turns in the same direction. My point is that the picture in the new rules shows that this is allowed. But they still have not updated the text to make this clear.

Respuesta 3:
Sometimes text is supplemented with pictures to help clarify, so don't discount the pictures and rely solely on the text wording. That is actually ignoring 1/2 of the rules and saying it isn't clear. This is especially important in a world of different languages.

In this case between the rules text and pictures is should clear up any confusion. In the Big Box rules they show both a valid and invalid U-Turn.

As Maximilian above said two turn in the same direction are allowed as long as they are not consecutive tiles.

I hope this helps,

Respuesta 4:
Whatever the text and pictures represent, the intent is clear: it is to prevent not being able to lay a subsequent river tile becasue of an immediate U-turn. This is always avoidable by disallowing an immediate u-turn, but as said above, if the immediate turn would not prevent the next river tile being laid (whatever it might be) then that can be house-ruled.

Also puzzling: it lets you rotate the "T" junction from River II. So instead of having the river outlets be perpendicular to the source, you can have just one be perpendicular to it. It still lets you make turns from both ends, so it's possible to have dead spaces with River II in the app this way.

You may be a mathematician but a lot of game designers and publishers are not. If you want to indulge in a very futile exercise simply jump over the Fantasy Flight Web site's community form for X-Wing. Star Wars: X-Wing has an FAQ that is as long as the rules. There are more threads that I can could which are about how there is more than one way to interpret the rule or rules. The X-Wing FAQ grows with every release.

Since the text in English may not have been as clear some wish we need to rely on the full rules, pictures and text for an understanding. Then is is not really confusing at all really. Carcassonne is far from confusing.

As you can see, it has been pointed out that the app has implemented the rules incorrectly. To me, that is evidence that the rules are confusing.

If you go to the forum and do a search for river and u-turn, you will see a lot of threads about this topic, with people interpreting the rules differently. To me, that is evidence that the rules are confusing.

You seem to think that it is OK to state a rule in an ambigiuous way provided you then add a picture that contradicts the statement. Your view seems to be that people should then be able to deduce the correct interpretation. I'm not disputing that in this case it probably works from a practical point of view, but I do not find it satisfying. If I set an exam for my students where they had to do something like that, I would get lots of complaints. It is amazing how easily confused people can be, and how statements I thought are obvious could be interpreted differently. What if people do not look at the picture? What if they first spend a long time reading the text over and over again before they spot the picture? What if in the next edition they copy the text and add a picture that does not show this u-turn?

I read game rules the same way I read exam papers, text books and mathematical papers. I want precision. In this case they only had to add a couple of words to make it unambiguous, and after so many editions, I would have thought that they could have done that.

You seem to be surprised that I find the rules confusing since I have many games. My guess is that the more experienced people are, the better they will be at spotting confusing parts in the rules.

It seems that we interpret the word "confusing" differently. To me, the rules are confusing if they can be interpreted differently, as can be seen from the app example and the many threads on this forum. To you, it seems that confusing has to deal with the complexity. And I of course agree that the rules are not complex. (However, I do have a hard time keeping track of all the changes to the rules of Carcassonne regarding the scoring of cities and fields in the various edition.)

Respuesta 17:
We have this phrase called 'Proof Texting' which is when someone takes part of a statement, in this case a rule, out of context and builds an argument around that. The picture taken with the text seems clear to most. So if the text is confusing you, take the entire rules are published. The rules from the latest Big Box even has two pictures for better clarity. I would recommend down loading them from the publisher and using those for reference.

We all wish that more games had rules less open to interpretation. But we've always had games like that; we wish they were better. But I think the intent is obvious and the rules as a whole are clear. Oh well, they aren't. When I went back saw so many posts about something so simple and obvious I thought I was suckered by someone trolling the internet.

If it bothers you as much as you seem to indicate, I don't think I have any advice other than: House rule it; right the publishers and complain; don't play the game. In any case I'm probably one of the less qualified to give advice, so feel free to ignore it.

I get you there. I think there is enough room for "However, the U-Turn pictured is legal as it's not immediate" in the paragraph (depending on how wordy they want to get), though can understand that they wanted to not have a booklet with a bunch of dead space or blank pages as the other 2 modules don't need to be that wordy. Or they could have done a 2 page brochure with a TOC page, the farmers and River Abbots on the second page, and the tile breakdown on the back page. I can also agree that it feels like the Appendix was written with those experienced with the old editions of Carcassonne in mind or those experienced with playing JCloisterzone, an open-source implementation made by fans, yet Carc is considered to be one of the big 4 gateway games to hobby gaming. At the same time, I don't find the word 'Immediate' to be ambiguous in terms of carcassonne, I take it as "If the next tile revealed is a turn tile coming off of another turn tile, you must S the river instead of U-ing it"

Respuesta 24:
I'll add one other thing, the rules in the latest edition do seem to be the most ambiguous.

Big box one rules (Rio Grande Translation):
"Place these tiles so that the river on each connects to the river on the previous tile. Do not place a river tile so that the river makes a 'U' turn."

Big Box Five rules (Z-Man Translation):
"When placing a River tile, a player may choose the orientation, but may not choose to place a tile that would cause the river to make a u-turn."

Carcassonne 2.0 rules (Z-Man Translation):
"As usual, you must continue the illustration. Furthermore, you must continue the river illustration, and the river cannot turn twice in the same direction because this would create a u-turn."

The earlier rules talk about placing a tile and what to do. So when you place a river tile, you can't make a u-turn. But the whole continue the illustration verbiage and the turn twice in the same direction doesn't really indicate that it's only when place the next tile.



Tema 166: Gardens and Cult Shrines, Abbots and Besieged Cities clarification
Pregunta:
The Abbot is a mini-expansion introducing Gardens and the ABBOT meeple which you may play on Cloisters (Monasteries) & Gardens.

Gardens work the same way that Cloisters (Monasteries) work, based upon the number of adjacent tiles.

Cult Shrines are a mini-expansion that creates a contest with Cloisters (sometimes called Monasteries)/Abbeys. The Instructions specifically mention Cloisters and Abbeys.

For those unfamiliar -- if a Cult Shrine and Cloister are adjacent, the first to complete gets points, the other gets nothing. Otherwise, they score and function as a Cloister. If a contest completes simultaneously, both score fully. You cannot place tiles so that a three-way contest would be formed.

Can an ABBOT be placed on a Cult Shrine? Thematically I would say MAYBE, (Cults compete with the Abbot's Cloisters) but Cult Shrines otherwise function like Cloisters--so YES?

Can a Garden compete with a Cult Shrine? I can't tell if the Cult came before or After the Abbot. It specifically mentions the Abbey--which is something else. Thematically I would think again NO (gardens aren't religious buildings)? but since an Abbot is limited to Cloisters & Gardens ...then a Garden would be competition for a CULT.

I have a feeling both answers are YES.


SIEGE / CATHARS adds the Siege of a CITY. A siege tile adjacent to a City reduces all scoring for a city by 1 pt and doubles the value of a Besieged city for Farmers. If a Besieged City has a Cloister adjacent, you may remove your Meeple from the City at the end of any turn.

First off, the instructions say "a Cloister" not "your Cloister", so any Cloister is a get out of town card for everyone in a Besieged City.

Would a Cult Shrine count as a Cloister for the Besieged mechanic of taking out meeples? I would think YES.

Would a Garden count as a Cloister for the same Besieged mechanic? Since the Abbot treats a Garden as Cloister--I'm thinking YES?

Again, I all the answers are YES. (mostly for simplicity of rules)

Respuesta 1:
Cloisters/Monasteries, Abbeys, and Shrines are all treated the same for Abbots. They can be claimed by then normally and all function as cloisters except in regards to their special rules. Gardens can only be claimed by Abbots and Gardens do not count as cloisters for the purpose of Shrines or Cathars.



Tema 167: Do you need to mark places that have been taken?
Pregunta:
Hi everyone!

Say I I've just added a tile and that created a city but I have no meeples left to take it. Maybe the next player does not notice it and that would leave that city empty.

How do we differentiate that city from others that have already been taken? Or since the city was finished without any meeple inside then does it become unavailable as the other finished cities?

Respuesta 1:
Yes, it would be unavailable. You can only put a meeple on a tile you've just placed (until you include certain expansions, that is).

Respuesta 2:
Wait a second, I did not know that.

So say there is a incomplete city and I put a tile of a road not even near it. I cannot put my Meeple in that incomplete city, I need to place it the tile I've just placed or not place it at all. Is that right?

Respuesta 3:

Wait a second, I did not know that.

So say there is a incomplete city and I put a tile of a road not even near it. I cannot put my Meeple in that incomplete city, I need to place it the tile I've just placed or not place it at all. Is that right?
That's right. If the tile you just placed only had a road on it, your options would be Robber or Farmer and that's it. And even then, only if there are no other Robbers on the road already and no other Farmers in the field.

That is right. By asking, it makes me strongly suspect you that have been taught incorrectly by someone else, and have never read the rules yourself (which are very plain about this in my English copy).

Elsewhere in this forum there are multiple threads that reinforce the precise order in which steps of a turn must be taken (because you are not alone).

The player may place a meeple from her supply onto the tile she has just placed.



Tema 168: After completion of a feature
Pregunta:
We have played many games over the past 3/4 years but keep finding little things that we haven't been doing quite right. E.g. counting some roads that cross a T junction as a single road (acc to CAR ALL roads end at T junctions).
Our main problem at the moment is that we cannot find any reference to what happens if you lay a monastery tile and it completes another of your monasteries. Can the new monastery still be claimed or do you have to wait for the next turn before laying another meeple as in all other instances?
We're in a dilemma over this. Last night we allowed the new monastery to be claimed but then didn't allow the completed monastery to be claimed and scored until another turn when no meeple was played. Is this correct?

No that is not correct. After the tile is placed, then a meeple may be played on the tile if desired. Then all completed features are scored and then meeples on completed features are returned. The cloister (monastery) may be claimed and then the completed one scored.

I added some emphasis: You might just be confused on the terminology here, but I thought I should address this quoted part.

You may never claim (place a meeple on) a tile that was placed on a previous turn. But if the "old" monestary that was completed already had a meeple on it from a previous turn, then yes, the "old" monestary should have been scored as normal. But, you could not claim it on your turn.

Respuesta 3:
Making it simple:

1. Place a tile in a valid place. (Ignore any completed features at this point.)

2. May optionally place a meeple on the just-placed tile if you have any on the supply. (Ignore any completed features at this point.)

3. Score all completed features, removing meeples from all completed features, returning them to their respective supplies.


In step 3. it does not matter whether the meeple was just placed on step 2 or on previous turns.

Thanks for all these comments guys and bearing with me. I've re-read the CAR pdf and obviously misinterpreted the completion rules but the comments are always useful.



Tema 169: Does this gap between castles continue a field?

No. When city tiles touch, the field is broken.

Always assume that a city wall heading toward a corner closes off the corner. When those small gaps appear, it's just due to printing and cutting being slightly off-center.

I find that one the hardest concepts for people to grasp about Carcassonne is that nothing ever matches at a corner (even if it looks like it should). Only the edges matter.

So, only the tile *edges* matter.

Friend of mine only brought it up endgame because he didn't have enough farmers to own the big field that always appears.



Tema 170: Are those monasteries with roads?
Pregunta:
Hi everyone. Just bought the 2016 version with 2 expansions.

So, the monasteries in the rules explanation have field all around them.

There are though, a couple of monasteries (the design is different, but it's obviously a Monastery) that have a road leading to them.
Should I ignore those, or do they count as Monasteries?

Respuesta 2:

Yep, so, the monastery with the road can fit into a hole with 3 fields and a road leading to it, but not with 4 fields surrounding the hole. Of course, it doesn't HAVE to be a hole, as per standard carcassonne rules, just was saying as that was the example Jim gave

I'm glad to see this post. I've always thought the rules had a mistake. The section describing the monastery only shows the one without the road.

I don't understand the confusion either. Is a city tile not a city if there's also a road on the tile? A bunch of tiles have multiple features to them, but that doesn't mean only one is a valid choice to place your meeple on.

Also, all of the monasteries in both art styles use the same art across all permutations of having a monastery (2 roads, 3 roads, or 4 roads with a monastery on them in many of the expansions, as well as the city with the monastery in the city from Princess and Dragon).

In the base set alone, 6 of the tiles should have a monastary on them: 4 completely surrounded with fields and 2 with 1 road coming off of it. Regardless if there's a road or not (or a city in PAD's case), the monastery will always score when 8 tiles are adjacent to it (9 points) or during endgame scoring 2-8 points (depending the amount of tiles in that monastery's 3x3 grid, including the monastery itself). Though, that doesn't stop the monastery from scoring other features too depending on if it terminates the road or the Monastery in the City closes off the city it's in.

Yeah, I can get the confusion with them using a Monastery in the road later on for a different reason, but they were more using it as an example for how 2 different player's meeples end up sharing the same segment (also, since Monasteries also ends roads, it was used to show how to score such an occurrence in the same turn). Also, in the end game scoring section of the new rules it does show a monastery with a road being scored as an incomplete monastery at the end of the game (owned by yellow, example gives yellow 4 points).

Pretty much, follow what the rulebook says for what counts as a Monastery: Monasteries are always depicted in the center of a tile. For further clarification: a Monastery always look like a 'big church' in the center of the tile. Or, at least near the center of the tile in the case with the Monastery in the City from Princess and Dragon or the Riverside Monastery in the River Expansion(s), but those still count as they look the same as those in a field or connected to 1 or more roads.

Respuesta 13:
To me this thread helps clarify/confirm things because the monastery tile with a road “looks” different than the monastery tile without.
Monastery with a road - tower, big building, small building
Monastery without a road - tower, two small buildings, one slightly larger building, one silo
So naturally, this would beg any good detail-minded OCD gamer to question if they’re different. But the new rule book thankfully has a picture of each describing both versions as monasteries. So we can all sleep better.



Tema 171: The Tower - placing tower segments
Pregunta:
Hello,
I need a clarification about the Tower expansion. I couldn't find the same questions in any other posts.
When can I place the tower segment on an existing tower, or place a meeple on top of an existing tower? I can place it when i placed a tower tile, or I can place it when I place any tile, regardless the set to which the tile belongs?

Thanks in advance!

Respuesta 1:
Hi Luciano,
as far as I know you can play a tower segment or a meeple on top of a tower only when you play a tower tile (a tile with a tower foundation on it).

Reported from Carcassonne Complete Annotated Rules 7.4:

Quote:
1. Place a Tile
The new land tiles are placed in the usual way. Apart from the tower foundations, there are no new elements on the tiles.

2. Deploy a follower
Instead of moving the fairy or deploying a follower, builder, or pig, a player may now decide to place one of his or her tower pieces on any tile with a tower foundation which is already in play, or on a tower which is already under construction; or to finish the construction of a tower by deploying a follower to the top of it.
All the best!

Respuesta 2:
I would say it's the other way around. You can place a tower piece or block it with your meeple whenever you don't put a meeple on your tile. There is nothing about "tower tile" in point 2.

Update: found this .

Respuesta 3:
Thank you very much, I think this definitely answers the question... The tower brick can be placed even if you have played a tile that does not contain the tower icon.



Tema 172: City Clarification
Pregunta:
I'm sure these are really easy questions for long-time Carcassone fans, but for the life of me, I can't figure out if I'm scoring my cities properly.

Looking at the above picture, at the last tile on the left, it's a two-sided city tile. However, the red meeple still only gets 3 incomplete points (+1 for the flag), correct? Because it is still one tile.

HOWEVER, if there was a blue meeple on one of the cities, the blue meeple would get 1 point and the red meeple would still get 3 (+1 for the flag). Right?

Also, what if a red meeple had claimed a city and then later placed another city tile, but with a wall connecting to a wall. And they didn't place another meeple because they intended it to be one, big city. If the city remained incomplete, would this separate tile be counted into their city total? Even if their meeple isn't on it? For a picture description, look at the above picture and pretend that the left tile and middle tile are only connected via that wall. (This is what I'm having the most trouble with, so I hope this question makes sense)

When people start fighting for cities, scoring becomes a little difficult for me.

The tile on the left has 2 city segments. They are separate segments, they are not currently connected to each other.

If gameplay continued they might become joined into a single city, or they might become parts of entirely different cities.

Do not let that independent open ended segment on the top edge confuse you about scoring.

Does this mean that, if there are two city tiles, only connected via a wall, but with a meeple on only one of the tiles, if incomplete, that meeple would only get 1 city point and NOT 2, even though the same person placed the second city tile?

When you say "only connected by a wall" what you really mean is "not connected". The tile on the left in your example shows two independent cities (until such time as they are fully connected through other tiles).

To answer your outstanding question, who placed the tile and their intentions when doing so have no bearing on the score at the end of the game. If you don't have a meeple on a feature, it's not yours, end of story. It doesn't matter if you'd intended to connect it up to another city. If you haven't done so by the end of the game, they're separate.

What he is saying is that the two sections of wall in the left-most tile are just that - two (distinct) sections of wall. They are not joined at the corner of the tile, the corner has two ends-of-wall facing each other (albeit with no space between the faces of the wall).

If two more tiles were placed along the top, with walls into that corner, then those wall would continue to be distinct and diverge again, enclosing two separate cities (albeit with their walls' faces touching each other in that corner).

However, if two more tiles were placed along the top with open city and no walls then those city sections would join into one city (albeit one with the wall at that corner being two bits of wall joined at their faces rather than their ends).

Intention doesn't matter. If the disconnected city section has no meeple on it, it does not score. At game end, only features with meeples on them score.

In other words, you are correct: the second (separate) city tile does not score unless you put a meeple on it.


(And as has already been explained, "connected by a wall" is meaningless within the context of the scoring rules. Connection across tiles is only by open city edge to open city edge, and the left-most tile in your photo has parts of what are currently two separate cities.)

It should also be noted that if those two city segments on the left tile *are* connected into a single city, they only count as one tile (because they are one tile) for scoring that city. That tile adds only 1 point to the city, or 2 if it's completed.

At least as of the New Art editions of Carcassonne they are on the variant sheet (in the Z-man (NA) version), along where you'd find the rules for the River and Abbots.

I'm playing with my wife and kids so we're sticking to the basic rules with no farmers for the time being.

If there is a meeple on the tile (indicating who played it) and not a lot of stuff built around it, I would tell them to move the tile into a new valid position and just leave the meeple where it is. If you cannot tell who put it there or people are already building upon the misplaced tile, it's your call if you keep playing like that and avoid further complications (just be a little more careful next time), or agree to move it to a valid place where doesn't directly benefit anyone for fairness.

If there are experienced players in the game, I'd say they share some of the burden. It's not like it's a game where people are playing into their own tableaux/play areas. Every tile placed is a public spectacle, and each player observes that.

That said, I've had a couple of games where we realized that a meeple didn't "backdoor" into a feature, and we just had the later meeple removed.

Can you place a pig in addition to the meeple or instead of placing a meeple?

Is it in the rules and I missed it?

Thank you,

it's instead of, and only when there's already a farmer of yours in the field from a previous turn.

Tema 177: Scoring and Placing
Pregunta:
Can you score a tile and place a Meeple on the same move? i.e. your tile both closes a road and has part of a city. Assume I have claimed that road, can I remove my Meeple, score the points, and then place a Meeple in that city portion?

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
The order is
1.Place tile
2.Optionally place a meeple on the placed tile
3.Score completed features, return the appropriate meeples to the supply

You thus have to have a meeple on the supply to be able to both place one and score and get one (or more) back.

You cannot perform the steps in a reverse order.

Respuesta 2:
Ok so as long as a Meeple is available, then it can be done. Thank you.

Respuesta 3:
Also note that it is possible to place a meeple on the feature that you just completed (as long as it was previously unclaimed) and then immediately score it and remove that meeple.

Respuesta 4:

@koZone
... Assume I have claimed that road, can I remove my Meeple, score the points, and then place a Meeple in that city portion?
Meaning you've claimed the road on some previous turn? Then yes, it would be as Pasi explains.
If you're questioning whether you can claim that road and the city in the same turn, the answer is no - barring any of the certain expanions that may allow it.



Tema 178: Creating an empty space possible?
Pregunta:
Hello! Is it allowed to place a tile that creates a one tile-sized empty space? We had a disagreement during our last game. Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
Yes, it is allowed.

Respuesta 2:
As long as the placed tile shares at least one edge with an already placed tile, and all of the edges of the placed tile match each edge they share, other edges do not matter.

Shortly: yes, holes do appear. And there may not be a tile that fits the hole created. Tough luck if you are trapped like that.

Respuesta 3:
It's entirely possible to leave an empty space that is surrounded!

No argument there!

This can be a common occurrence. If this were an issue I'm sure it would have been be clearly stated in the rules.

In fact, the Abbey in   might have been partcially created for these gaps!

Respuesta 4:
OK, good haha. Thanks everyone!

Respuesta 5:
Not only is it allowed, it is actually good strategy - when you've played enough to know what tiles exist in the game, you can start making impossible to fill holes on purpose to block opponents from completing their things and getting meeples back.

Respuesta 6:
We always play to try to create an empty space around monasteries

Played with a player who was OCD. Any holes, she would go out of her way and fill, even if there would be a much better placement for that tile!

In Alhambra all tiles must connect to the center tile and you cannot go through walls. I'm pretty sure you could still crate an Alhambra that has a hole in it, but it would take quite a lot of suitable tiles so it might be impossible in practice. Whether the hole is fillable later depends on the tiles.

But in Alhambra everyone is building their own, so you won't have a goal of hindering yourself. It happens if it happens.

Tema 179: Scoring farmers
Pregunta:
I need help with a farmer scoring issue. I'm second guessing myself here in the image. Is the red farmers in the same field as the yellow. I'm unsure if I should be counting it but my gut says that the monastery is not blocking the field and should get points for red.

Tema 180: Mega Carc at local convention - Special rules ?
Pregunta:
I'm currently working toward getting 12 base game of Carcassonne to play a Mega Game at a local convention. If they all have the river, that puts me just over 1000 tiles. I felt like it was a good number to try to hit. Nothing close to a record but impressive to look at.

But with that amount of tiles, there has to be additional rules right ? At least adding some meeples or something ?

I couldn't find anything about that in the files so I am asking for your advice.

So here's what I've been thinking:
- Adding a 6th player. The size can obviously allow it.
- 12 meeples instead of the original 8.

I feel having more than 12 would be useless. While the possible moves are increased, having too many meeples would just make the whole game a farming galore. Where's the fun in that.

I also want to keep it at only base game to make it more accessible. Much easier to explain to less seasoned players.

Of course, such event will be scheduled and I think a good 6 hours block should be enough to finish it, requiring an average 2.7 tiles per minute. No AP allowed !

What do you guys think ?

Respuesta 1:
Sounds like fun. Let us all know how it goes. You may need to modify the river rules, since extra long rivers can become unwieldy more often than not. My advice, don't use more than 40 river tiles or so, with the tiles from 12 full games. Also even with 6 players, everyone will play about 150 tiles each, so more meeples means more interaction during game play, fewer meeples means less interaction during game play.

My custom variation of the river tile placement rule (official: no U turns.): A river tile cannot be placed that forces the next river tile to be placed adjacent to two tiles (including the one previously placed). So no immediate u-turns, but (for example) left-straight-left is okay.

The main guidelines for meeples is that you don't want too few so that everyone's meeples are trapped on the board and can't be recovered or too many that placement strategy is lost. Finding the ultimate sweet spot is made even tougher because there are different playing styles.

Respuesta 6:
I guess this can work as a session report ?

Invited a friend over to playtest this. Here's what we played with:
- 4 base games
- 12 meeples each (+1 on the scoreboard)
- 3 river sets

We started with one river source and I mixed all the other river tiles in a small pile and we drew from it. We followed a "no u-turn" rule and ended up with 25 tiles when we got the end of the river. It provided a really nice start.

In the future I will only have one river end that I will mix in after 20 tiles. This way we get a decent river without knowing when it will exactly end.

We played for around 1hour and a half, this being my friend first game. We hadn't seen each other in a while so we were not entirely focused on the game and were not trying to block each other off. In total, we played 223 tiles including the river.

He had to leave after that so we finished scoring and he beat me by 9 points, 379 to 388.

The 12 meeples decision was good for the small size we had. I think as I get close to 1000 tiles, I will use 15 meeples.

I have a couple of additional comments, partially around the river idea but more particularly around farming.

In my experience, starting out with The River helps to enable larger farms. If you get another chance to playtest, pay attention to that, and if you don't want a huge farm-fest, be careful with it. (I do like starting with the River though, so I'm not saying "don't do it".)

(There is a version of the River that has a road crossing on the source/spring tile, and possibly also features that break up the lake tile(s); this helps to diminish the giant-farm tendency induced by the River. I don't think that's The River II , which includes a fork in the river and two lake tiles, although one of the lakes does include a city edge.)

My other comment is that the expansion tiles - at least from the first two expansions, which I know best - have a higher concentration of cities & roads, and therefore also have a higher tendency to break up farms than tiles from the base game do. You might consider including expansion tiles for this reason even if you don't use the expansion rules.

Good luck! I hope you have a great event.

That would be the Mini Expansion. It has 10 base tiles plus two river tiles, one of which is a replacement lake/spring with a road that divides it into two fields.



Tema 181: Completing a city with a takeover
Pregunta:
Hey everyone,

so the situation is as follows:

Player A is starting a city with a knight in it. Player B starts a new city independently from player A by placing a tile that connects only at the edge. A few turns later player B has the opportunity to continue his city by getting into the city of player A.
Here comes the problem I'm not sure about.
Player A city is still open on the other side meaning that whole "megalopolis" is not yet completely closed but just the side of it where player Bs city started.
From here now on player B has 2 meeples in the city and player A only has one. Does this now become a race between the two players to close the other side or is this not even possible (meaning you can't connect to the other players city if the other side of it is still open)? Or to put it differently; is it only allowed to close out a city with other players involved with the final tile when there are no other possibilities for that city to grow?

Hope I didn't complicate this too much but I'm open for clarifications if needed.

I'm talking about the base game with no expansions.

Thank you!

Respuesta 1:
It's perfectly fine for two cities to join up and not be completed. It can be completed at a later time.
The presence of followers in the city only has relevance to ownership and has nothing to do with completing or not completing the city.

Respuesta 2:
You can always place tiles anywhere they match. It's only your meeples that have restrictions based on claimed features.

Respuesta 3:
Thanks for the quick reply!

So basically after the cities are joined, but not closed, both players can evenly try during their turns to close the other side by placing the tiles and meeples to achieve majority in the new "megalopolis"?

You can keep adding tiles, but you can't place meeples in a feature that already has a meeple. So if you place the first tile of a city and add a meeple, and then someone places a city tile that is close but not connected, they can place a meeple. At that point, any city tiles that are connected to either of those cannot have a meeple added since they both already have a meeple. If they are joined by a tile to make them one city, there will still only be one meeple of each color, and both players can try to complete it.

If you lay a 3rd non-joined tile, you can add a meeple to it and then try to connect it later to the other parts and end up with more meeples than your opponent.

Respuesta 5:
That clears up everything, thank you very much!

Respuesta 6:
Others have alluded to this, but just to state it explicitly since I think this might be a point of confusion: Having a follower in a city in no way prevents other players from adding tiles to that city, it only prevents them (and you for that matter) from adding a meeple to the tile that they place.

You can always add a city tile to somebody else's city, it's just a matter of if that is a beneficial move or not. I know one of my favorite moves near the end of a game is to add the four edge courtyard piece to somebody's almost finished castle so they have no chance of finishing it by game end.

Respuesta 7:
Yes, and to add one final clarification: Other players can be extending the megalopolis, as well, regardless of whether they have meeples there. You are allowed to spend the whole game improving other people's features (or nobody's at all!) if you want….

Respuesta 8:
As a side note, the Traders & Builders  expansion gives you a potential reason for completing a city owned by another player: resources in a city go to the player who completes it rather than the player who owns it. Some of the stand-alone Carc versions also provide incentives for completing regions owned by another player.

Respuesta 9:
And to the people that don't know why you'd want to use your tiles extending another player's city, try placing that brown city-on-all-sides tile on a city that's not yours and then watch its owner squirm, because they'll have a very hard time trying to close that thing.

It's not always done to benefit them, but also to prevent them from scoring a big one.

I once played a 5 player game with several expansions in which 3 or 4 of us were competing for a city with a cathedral, and the city was getting really big.

Thank you for that clarification. I'll take it as the final nail in the coffin for this conundrum.

Respuesta 3:
See here:  

It seems which features are used to define how tiles are scored have changed in the rules (villages instead of crossroads). You should read the thread through to the end.

I wrote in the thread after reading the rules
wrote:
In the new graphics all crossings have villages. (And there are no core tiles with a village on the road without a crossing.)

The tile with the village on the road is from an expansion. According to the new core rules it seems that the village on the straight road on the left does end the road.
But the expansion tile gives an example that contradicts the rules. So, house-rule it.

Tema 185: Question about points from pennants and farmers
Pregunta:
I am sorry if this has been asked before. I admit I've been a little bit lazy to search the numerous posts.

In the rules of the original version of the game I have, it is mentioned that for each pennant, we score 2 points per pennant in our city and that each farmer in the fields provide 4 points per complete city. Having bought 2 expansions (Inns & cathedrals and Farmers & builders) I have assumed that, for some reason the points assigned in each case have been changed to 3 points per pennant and also 3 points for each city supported by a farmer.

Am I missing something? Is it officially changed at some point? What is the correct points assigned in each case?

Thank you in advance for all answers.

Respuesta 1:
Under current scoring,
1) each pennant adds 2 points to the total value of a completed city, or 1 point to an incomplete city at game end.
2) each city supported by a farmer adds 3 points. Cities may be supported by multiple farms (on separate farms) and will score for each farm.

Farm scoring has changed from the original edition; AFIK pennants have not.

Respuesta 2:

@jdewit
1) each pennant adds 1 point to the total value of a city.

Thank you all, but it seems there is a problem here. In the expansion of Inns & Cathedrals (I have it in Italian language), there is an example of evaluation of a city with 6 tiles, 1 cathedral among them and 2 other tiles with pennants. The example shows that this city counts 24 points (3*6 for the cathedral + 2*3 for the pennants).
I have also downloaded an English translation where the same example is shown. In this example, the poster writes that there is a mistake in the rules of the Carcassonne Big Box, where this city is wrongly counted for 24 points and that the points of this city are 21. The thing is that in the illustration of the example, one of the pennants (if there is one) is covered by a meeple. The explanation of counting 21 points is 3*6 for the cathedral and 3 points for 1 pennant.
No matter which of the 2 counts you take into consideration, the pennants are counted (in both examples) for 3 points each. If they were counted for 2 points, first result would be 22 points and second result 20 points.

I have also in front of me the rules of the Greek original version where it is stated that farmers give 4 points per complete city.

So, if your writings are correct, I have 3 versions of the rules wrongly written (1 for base game and 2 for the expansions).

Tema 186: 30 point bonus
Pregunta:
Last night I was playing an online game, and when one of the cities was completed one of the players got a huge bonus. Close to 30 points.

Can anyone point me to what this is?

Respuesta 1:
Have you got any screenshots or logs of the game? Were you playing with any expansions? Was it just a really massive city?

Respuesta 2:
Did it have lots of pennants? Perhaps it had a Cathedral from Carcassonne: Expansion 1 – Inns & Cathedrals?

Respuesta 3:
I admit I have not played any online version, but one possibility might be the Cathedral which makes each city tile and pennant worth 3 points instead of 2. But that would still have to be either a pretty massive city, or one with lots of pennants. Again I don't know how the UI is on the version you are playing and how clear it is where the points specifically come from, but it might be that more than one feature was completed. This might not be immediately obvious if one of those completed features was unclaimed and they placed their meeple on it that turn.

In Carcassonne, Ark of the Covenant, if you put a prophet in the city once it is completed you receive double the points... perhaps this is where the extra 30 points is coming from.

What Michal said. With a large city containing a cathedral and several shields (pennants), 30 is easily attainable. My son once completed a 54 point city with those features--despite my best blocking efforts.
I got 48 with just base set:

Still, getting back to original OP, did this player get 30 points "beside" standard points for completing the city?



Tema 187: City Value?
Pregunta:
I thought I knew the rules pretty well, but a game on BGA has me questioning my understanding.

We closed the following city:

I was expecting to score (9 (tiles) + 4 (shields))x2 for 26 points, but the game gave me 2 more.

I assume it counts the top right square as 2 discrete tiles as they are isolated sections on a tile?

Is this the correct way to score this or should I just report a bug?

Thanks

Lucien

Respuesta 1:
I would agree that this is a bug - and should be 26 points as far as I know.

That city definitely looks like it should only score 26 points.

I would say bug as well. Scoring is per tile. If it was scored as 28, that was per segment. Sounds like someone didn't code it quite right...

Respuesta 4:
It's a bug. I reported it a while ago; there's even a slightly older bug report for the same issue, as it turned out.

Edit: The older report ist this one: https://en.boardgamearena.com/#!bug?id=6356

Respuesta 5:
Yep, your understanding of the rule outside of BGA is correct. When I teach it, I do use the exact words "2 points PER TILE" for ingame scoring and "1 point PER TILE" for end game scoring. About halfway through (when the bag gets lighter) I remind the endgame scoring 'penalty', as I call it.

Respuesta 6:
It is quite common to find buggy games at BGA. I know of a bug report that's been sitting there for a year, and it's not even a real bug, it's just that no dev has even checked it out.

(yours is a real bug, tho, like others have pointed out)



Tema 188: Mandatory scoring


Tema 189: Ambiguous tile (see image)
Pregunta:
The last game I played sparked a bit of a debate. Is the road on the left hand river tile terminated by a village? It seems somewhat unclear but it certainly looks like a village. If it is a terminator, would the connecting road on the right hand tile only score 1 point if there was a meeple on it?

Respuesta 1:
If I remember correctly it is the bridge that ends the road... So that road through the village on the left ending on the right would be 2 points.

That's also what I thought when I looked at it

Respuesta 3:
I don't understand the confusion. As far as I know, only unfinished roads can give you 1 point. All finished roads are always made up of at least two tiles.

(You are counting the number of tiles, not the number of road segments.)

Respuesta 4:
There's no ambiguous... the road dosen't ends and continues with the bridge... I don't understand which is the problem....

Respuesta 5:
I'm not sure in which versions of rules I've read it, but It's common understanding that crossroad finish road. There is no crossroad on the left tile, so road does not end.

Still I agree, that graphical representation on those tiles may be confusing.

Respuesta 6:
A crossroad with a village in it does end a road; a crossroad without a village does not.
A bridge does NOT end a road.
A simple T-junction does NOT end a road; the T-junction with a village (as shown) DOES end a road.

Edit: excuse my stupidity. I was thinking of the "roundabout" tile on Abbey and Mayor. AFAICT all T-junctions have villages or clumps of trees which indeed DO end the segments. My bad.

Answer: That's right! But since all crossings have the same effect - namely, to bring a road to an end - it was decided to sacrifice the distinction between crossings and junctions (or T-crossings, or T-roads...?) in order to not unnecessarily complicate matters.

Answer: Every crossing (or junction) ends a road, irrespective of which direction they reach the junction from. The thieves cannot enter the small villages on the junctions either. In the example shown, every thief is on its own road

Harrumph! I certainly prefer the "unnecessary complication" of T-junctions extending roads not ending them: it makes it harder to complete roads. We've always played that way - and have thus never thought to check for a contrary ruling in the SCAR - and will probably continue to do so, but it seems it's been officially ruled otherwise.

I played a hundreds of sessions of Carcassonne with the rule that junctions ends a road. Also on android, jclosterzone and board game arene, where machine is taking care of the rules.

Thanks for the info lads. To be clear then, the offending tile is a regular continuous single road that crosses a river over of bridge and runs through a village, neither the bridge or village are road terminals. The village in the tile is then an exception to the regular rules for scoring roads, in fact it should not be seen as a village but as flavour art that is similar to a village.

Excerpt from page 3 of the rules (Version with the River and Abbot)

Quote:
1. Scoring a road

The end of a road is closed when it meets a village, a city, a
monastery, or it loops onto itself by meeting the other end.

The new core box seems to have the same rule. You learn something new..

I first considered it a badly worded rule which only takes into account the graphics of the newest version. In the new graphics all crossings have villages. (And there are no core tiles with a village on the road without a crossing.)

The tile with the village on the road is from an expansion. According to the new core rules it seems that the village on the straight road on the left does end the road. (And grants 2 points, because the road consisted of 2 tiles.)

There may be similar tiles in the old version, but I have only seen a few of the first, and in those the only similar tile is the 2-road Monastery.

Sorry, this is just not correct. The village on the left does not end the Road, since the Road goes "through" the City and "over" the Bridge. At the end of the game the Road would score 2 points, right now it won't score since it is not yet finished. The rule for the new edition never states something like that (at least I haven't found it anywhere).

Can you please show us the rule you found about this and show or quote it?

There are expansions with tiles that show Roads finishing in streets, but the shown tile isn't one of them. Only the junction on the right tile ends the Road.

It was already quoted above by Patrick.

This huge change does not change anything regarding 2016 base set, because all crossroads have villages and all villages are on cross roads.

But when looking at river expansion you can find this problematic tile. At this point I would say that this river tile really split road in two.

Maybe this is just a result of some careless graphical designer work. I did not found any FAQ on 2016 version.

Just to clarify what the rules say:

A city is completed when it is surrounded by walls and there are no holes inside the city. Each tile in the
completed city is worth 2 points. Each coat of arms in the completed city is worth an extra 2 points.
And about multiple meeples:

Quote:
If there are multiple meeples in a single scored feature, the player with the most meeples is awarded full points and
all other players receive nothing (...)
This tell two things:
* you score per tile, not per meeple
* meeple count is only to know who will be scoring



Tema 191: Artwork images on some tiles of the 2014 CARCASSONNE Edition question...
Pregunta:
It says in the rules page 2, "Other graphical elements such as houses, people, or animals have no impact on the game."

They have Abbot Gardens on some of the tiles, which makes sense for them. But, the "Highwaymen", "House" and "Farm Animals" look like they should also have significance like the Abbot Garden Artwork...but the rules say, No they don't.

If they don't, I think it is poor game design because it is distracting otherwise..."oh, what are those Highwaymen there for?" "Nothing".

So, are any of these to be used with any of the expansions?

It's just bothersome because the consistency/continuity is messed up if the Abbot Gardens mean something, but the other stuff does not.

Thanks for helping me understand.

As of right now they don't do anything. Think of them as a unique tile that when you draw you can sit there and go "oh, this one has a little horse on it."

They may have expansions in mind for the future and will incorporate these elements into them, but as far as I know they are just for decoration right now.

Respuesta 2:

In the meanwhile, I may have to try allowing the Highwaymen tile to add +1 to scoring that road, the Animals and House add +1 to scoring a Farm for each tile.

I just can't look at them and pretend they have no meaning for the game play when they clearly look as though they should...like the Abbot Gardens.

With the previous edition (the older artwork), expansions came with explicit features in the artwork. No retrofitting of existing graphical elements (I think I have them all, plus many of the derivative games, and it sticks).

Tema 192: Unplayable tile / Monastery scoring / River expansion
Pregunta:
Hi


1. What happens when a player draws a tile and the only place that it can be placed is on to another players city? Does it need to be placed here? Or does the tile get discarded back to the box?

Further to this, can you do this anyway? Even if you don't have an otherwise unplayable tile? I realise you can't add a meeple but you might do it for another tactical purpose.

2. At the end of the game, when scoring for an uncompleted 9 square Monastery block, do you still get the points for the tiles diagonally placed (kitty-cornered)? That is they don't have any adjacent tiles to the Monastery.

3. When playing with the river expansion, does the lake card count as a turn for a player? Even though we all know what the next card is?

Cheers

Respuesta 1:
The tile in your example is not unplayable, it just has to be played somewhere you may not want to play it. Yes, it must be placed.
So long as there is a meeple on the Monastery then any of the up to eight surrounding tiles score in addition to the Monastery. They must be in one of the eight spots that surround the Monastery though.
It has been so long since I played with the River expansion I don't remember and will defer to somebody else.

I believe there is a rule difference between the River I and the River II. I own the river I, and the rule is that it counts as a turn.

To clarify why, it is because you can never place a meeple on a volcano since the dragon goes there automatically and would eat your meeple.

I'm pretty sure after all river tiles have been placed we have always placed the lake automatically (with River I that came with the Finnish/Nordic core box), then as our a house rule the next player places the original starting tile before the game continues normally. (Why waste a tile?)

Respuesta 11:
Here are the rules for the River from the rulebook available on the Z-Man website

http://www.zmangames.com/uploads/4/7/1/7/47170931/carcassonn...
-------
Setup

Set aside the "source" and "lake" tiles. The remaining River tiles are shuffled and stacked facedown. Finally, slide the lake tile under that stack and set the source tile as the starting point.

Gameplay

Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise one after the other, players place tiles as usual (including the possibility of placing a meeple), with the exception that they must draw tiles from the River tile stack. You must continue drawing from the River stack until it runs out of tiles.
As usual, you must continue the illustration. Furthermore, you must continue the river illustration, and the river cannot turn twice in the same direction because this would create a u-turn.
You may place meeples along the river following the normal rules.

It would suggest that the lake tile is a normal turn for a player.

The big box rules are slightly different:



This suggests the mouth isn't a players turn..

Respuesta 13:
If you're playing the new edition with a river and no farmers, then you might want to use the River 2 rule for ending the lake (lake gets placed between the turn after the river gets completed and before the next player takes their turn, the player who would have placed the lake would instead take a normal turn), mainly because, to me, it disadvantages the person who is forced to place the lake and effectively do nothing because it's just a field. That's how I run it when I teach the base game with the following module set:
Farmers: Off
River: On
Abbotts: On or Off
Also, if you're playing River 2 with no Princess and the Dragon, then the Volcano means nothing to the game.

Respuesta 14:
If you check the consolidated rules you will see that their is some ambiguity and differences of rules between different releases of the river. Its not an addition I particularly like so cannot offer much advice on it other than to say I've seen it played several different ways and none of them make the addition work any better.



Tema 193: Double dipping?
Pregunta:
Hi

What happens if you have no Meeples left when you draw a card, and the card that you draw lets you, for example, finish off one of your cities. This obviously lets you remove your Meeple to score but can you then use that Meeple that you just removed to then place on, for example, a road that was on the card you just placed? Or is that double dipping?

I realise that this would be okay to do if you already had a spare Meeple prior to drawing the card.

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
Since you didn't have a meeple in your available pool as you placed the tile and completing it, with scoring coming in AFTER placing followers, you cannot claim the road in your example on your turn, you have to wait to extend the road on a future turn before you can claim it.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks Matthew - I thought that may have been the case.

Respuesta 3:
Always follow the turn actions order:

- draw a tile (must)
- place the tile (must)
- deploy a follower (may) on the same tile (must)
- check and score any closed construction (must, but if you forget it, it's no hard to do so later)

So, you never can use a follower just scored on your turn. Must be one available on your hand.

I just want to make sure I am understanding scoring fields correctly.

Can you please score the fields in this game. This is a screen capture of the Android app with Inn's and Cathedrals and Traders and Builders.

Thanks!



PS My fist attempt at this post didn't seem to take.. if I end up with two posts, please delete one (Mods). Thanks

Respuesta 1:
There are two big fields one to the left with 5 cities owned by green (scored 5*4). One with ten cities shared by green and red where both have a pig so both receive (10*5). There are also a few fields on the outskirts with one or two cities adjacent to them and one of green's fields which has no completed cities in it so scores nothing.

Note if you have two men in a field and the others have none, you don't score twice.
If you have a big man in a field and the other person none, you don't score it twice.
If you have a big man in a field and the other person two men, you share the field meaning both players score.
A pig doesn't score on its own, it must be in a field with a man. In the case of a tie and one has a pig and the other doesn't both score but the person with the pig gets five for each city and the one without 4.

Respuesta 2:
You answered another question I had about the pigs... so you ONLY score for YOUR pigs.. not for your opponents pigs even if you have more farmers in the field than your opponent who owns the pig... is that correct?

The only time you score the extra point for a pig is with your OWN pig. Is that correct?

So it's 4 points per city and 5 with a pig?

Thanks

Hey I thought under the revised rules farms only score 3 per city (4 with a pig).

Correct.

(Our group also uses the hybrid rules with 4pt for each completed city connected to the field being scored.)

Respuesta 5:
The Android app scored the 10 cities at 40 points so it must be using 3 points per city and 4 with a pig.

This would be correct. And the initial reply didn't state anything else, either:

@nickjhay
There are two big fields one to the left with 5 cities owned by green (scored 5*4).
5 cities would score 5*3 normally, but score 5*4 due to the pig.
The confusion might come from the next sentence:
Quote:

This is NOT because both player have their pig in the field, but because of the pig heard tile from the "River II" expansion, which grants an extra +1 bonus to each player owning the farm. And this bonus is treated different from the "wooden pig" bonus, so adds to it. You would also get 3 per city, if you connect a farmer with pig and pig tile to a barn farm (from "Abbey & Mayor"), or 5 points per city from a barn farm with pig tile. (You can't have a barn farm with wooden pig, because the pig will be removed with it's farmer, if you connect it to a barn.)

Note: if you are true sticking to the official rules, the pigfarm tile should only provide it's bonus, if you are playing with "Traders & Builders" (which you did in this game, so there is no explanation, why the app neglected the tile). But since it is treated as a different feature then the wood pig (otherwise it would not provide an additional bonus, likewise two inns on a road or two cathedrals in a city) many people don't bother about that, and score the bonus regardless.

But that is sound with the rules, as this field is on the other side of the river then the pig herd. Just the fact, that it includes the corner of the tile, does not mean, that it should be granted the bonus. The pig herd itself must be on the farm. (And obviously always can be only on one farm, although this farm might of course include both sides of the tile in other games, e.g. if the pig herd tile is right next to the source or lake tile.)

So, I did misunderstood you after all. Strange, because the old "4 points per city" farm rule worked completely different. You got 4 points per city, if you had a majority of farmers touching it, this only once per city and regardless, if they were on the same field or not. A summery of the different farm rules with great example pictures can be found at Carcassonne Central in this forum thread.

Respuesta 11:
My friends and I play the old rules regarding farms. We hate the new ones.

Don't forget about the pig farm if you are playing with the River 2 tiles. That adds another point to farms that is added to the pig to score 6 points per farm.

You're talking about the "Hans im Glück 1st edition rules".

The other people are talking about the "Rio Grande Games old rules", which are more like the newer "Hans im Glück 3rd edition rules", but with 4 points per farmer instead of 3.

Yeah I liked the old rules. But I can see how the newer ones are a bit easier to understand and score. So I use them now.

Also, maybe the old rules were harder to integrate with some of the expansions?



Tema 195: City scoring at the end of the game
Pregunta:
What happend at the end of the game if a city is not closed and one persons has the most influence in the city. Is he/she allowed to score alone or are the other persons with influence in this city also allowed to score? I am 95% sure that just the person with the most influence is allowed to score

Respuesta 1:
Only the one with the most influence scores it. The others get nothing.

Respuesta 2:
Only the person who has majority of a city scores. They will score half of the normal points. So instead of 2 points per a tile, they will score 1 point per a tile at game end.

Unless there is a cathedral in the city... In which case no points are scored.

Respuesta 4:
The above answers are correct. I'll just add a few more points for clarity.

- If 2 or more players ties for most influence, all tied players get the points (don't split it).

- If the unfinished city contains a cathedral tile (from Inns & Cathedrals ), no points are scored for it.

- No one gets Trade Goods (from Traders & Builders ) from unfinished cities.

- shields in an uncompleted city are worth a point each to the player with the meeple majority in that city.

Do the rules leave you uncertain? Here is a quote as found the current Z-Man rules, copyright 2014, in a section titled "GAME END AND FINAL SCORING"

Once the game is over, all meeples still in play are scored: 
...
Each incomplete city is worth 1 point per tile and 1 point per coat of arms, which is only half the points.


This section says nothing special about scoring a feature that several players share, so it may be presumed that the rules stated earlier remain in effect. This quote from a "Summary" section with the heading "3. Scoring a feature"

* If there are multiple meeples in a single scored feature, the player with the most meeples is awarded full points and all other players receive nothing. When more than one player have the most meeples in a scored feature, the tied players all score full points.

Respuesta 7:
What if an incomplete city has opposing player's meeples in different parts of the city and the city is not connected. In other words, there is no way to not connect the two meeples within the same city, but there are no tiles left, leaving two separate cities.

If they're not connected, they're not the same city. Score them separately.

Why would there be no way not to? there are plenty of tiles that cap off two sides allowing you to keep cities from connected.

But as mentioned already, what could have been is irrelevant. You score the cities as they are and if they are not connected at the end of the game, they are separate cities.



Tema 196: Blocking off roads legal?
Pregunta:
Hi

New player here.

I ran into the following situation today and wanted to see what was the correct way of playing. I connected a city tile to another city tile but it resulted in a dead end of a road on an adjacent tile. Is this a legal move?

Respuesta 1:
Hi!

If I understand your situation correctly, this is not legal. Note that there are some city squares which show a small portion of road leading into the city, which legally terminates the road. If there is no road illustration at all on the city tile (where both edges meet) then this is an illegal move.

Enjoy your game!

Respuesta 2:
Carcassonne is a puzzle map game. All tiles sides must match when you display them .

EDIT: City with city, road with road and field with field.

Respuesta 3:
Thanks to everyone for clearing that up. Appreciate your help.



Tema 197: Unsure about points for thief/thieves.
Pregunta:
My first try at the game and I am in a position where I have a scoring question. This may be a simple question but I do not see anything in the rules that clarifies my situation. I have attached an image for context:



Basically, the road in question is where the yellow thief meeple was placed first. The red meeple was placed on the road at a later time before both the roads got completed by the right corner piece and ended up joining the two roads.

So who ends up getting points in this case? Are both red and yellow given the same amount of points?

Clarification will be much appreciated.

Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
Yes, both of you gain 16 points. In Carcassonne, tied players obtain the same points. When someone have the majority, then he scores alone and the others nothing. EDIT: There is not halved points situations in the base game.

Respuesta 2:
Red and Yellow would score the same amount (assuming that the red placement was within the guidelines that it could not be placed on a road that was already claimed).

It also looks like the 'yellow' Monk has also completed their score of the cloister.

Respuesta 3:
The order in which they were placed doesn't matter - if Red and Yellow both have the same number of thieves on the road, they both score the full number of points.

From the new edition rulebook:
Quote:
If there are multiple meeples in a single scored feature, the player with the most meeples is awarded full points and all other players receive nothing. When more than one player have the most meeples in a scored feature, the tied players all score full points.

Respuesta 4:
Stealing from the opponents is a very important tactic for more advanced players. You place your meeple on a close-by but unconnected feature where your opponent is building something big (city, road or field) and in later turns you try to connect them before they finish, so you share their points and minimize their advantage.

It's important to remember that they have to be unconnected at the time you place your meeple there, because you cannot put them on a feature that already has a meeple on it (even one of your own).

It's very common to try this on big fields with a lot of cities towards the end of the game.

Respuesta 5:
I saw that happen with a Megaopolis in my last Carcassonne game, it was pretty swingy as to who would claim the points, it ended up getting cathedraled AND copleted with a tie.



Tema 198: Abbot question
Pregunta:
Suppose the abbot is played on a tile and eventually built up to 6 points, before removing him early.

Could another player, or even the same player on a later turn reclaim that tile after it has been (partially) scored?

Respuesta 1:
No. You can only place a meeple on a tile you've just placed. All other tiles are off-limits.

Respuesta 2:
Wowzers. We've only been playing a week or two, but somehow completely missed that.

Game got a little chaotic when we would put meeple anywhere all willy-nilly.
If anyone's looking for an interesting house rule, that one can shake it up a bit.

thanks for the help!

Respuesta 3:
What's this about "removing him early"? You cannot remove a follower before a feature is completed.

Respuesta 4:
You can if it's the abbot (but you can only place the abbot on a monastery or garden).

Respuesta 5:
What is this abbot? I assumed he was talking about the monk, and you definitely cannot remove him before the monastery is completed. There is an abbot in Abbey & Mayor, but he doesn't work differently.

Respuesta 6:
He specifically said "abbott." It's a mini expansion that's part of the new version of the base game. It gives you a bit more flexibility if you want to bail out of a monastery early. You only have one abbott, and it can only go on a monastery.

It's been a while since I looked at the rules, but I don't recall the introduction of an abbot in Abbey & Mayor. There was an Abbey tile, which you could place a follower on as if it were cloister, but that follower was still a monk, like any other. He wasn't actually called an abbot, IIRC.

I guess this abbot follower is something new from another expansion. I've never heard of it either, but it sounds like a sissy monk who quits before the job is done. I'm glad I don't have this nonsense in my game; back in MY day, the monks were REAL monks. They didn't stop prayin' just because times were tough and points were scarce.

(So. Many. Expansions... I feel ya.)

Specific abbot rules on the last page. Unfortunately the abbot "expansion" isn't actually available separately, so the only way to get it is to repurchase the base game.

Respuesta 10:
But that won't give you the gardens, which are additions to existing tiles in the base game, and are pretty much essential for the abbot, otherwise it's only useful for monasteries, which really isn't enough.

Respuesta 12:
Andy Burgess
@MercifulBiscuit
No. You can only place a meeple on a tile you've just placed. All other tiles are off-limits.
Granted, we are due for a reprinting of The Princess and the Dragon, which contains tiles that have magic portals on them that allows you to place a follower on any incomplete feature that doesn't already have one IIRC. With the Abbott meeple being new, guess we're going to see new rules surrounding that.

Respuesta 13:
There are no special cases for the Abbot in the new Princess and Dragon printing. The German rules explicitly list: Abbots, Big Meeple, Mayors and Wagons can use magic portals.

Thus it's quite possible to quickly score a cloister with a Abbot and then score it again later when/if you receive a magic portal.



Tema 199: Claiming just completed elements?
Pregunta:
If there is a city portion that has not been completed or claimed, and I place a card down that completes that city, can I place a follower on my portion of the now complete city and get the points for it? Or is it now a completed city and unable to be claimed?

Respuesta 1:
Yes, you can score that city if you have a meeple available.

Ref: Re: Scoring a city and placing a meeple

Respuesta 3:

@steckman
Yes, you can score that city if you have a meeple available.
As long as there are no other meeples in the now completed city.

Respuesta 4:
You check for completed features only after (optionally) placing a meeple.

Respuesta 5:
I created a house rule prohibiting placing the meeple and scoring a previously empty feature in the same turn. Game scores are lower naturally, but I like the way it promotes building rather than quick scoring.

Of course it means my quick-scoring friend's winning streak might come to an end, purely by chance of course

Respuesta 6:
Thanks everybody for the replies. Appreciate it.



Tema 200: Farmer scoring-app gameplay
Pregunta:
For the life of me I cannot figure out the farmer scoring on the app gameplay. Is it different from the boardgame rules?

Respuesta 1:
Depends which edition of the rules you play with.

I use 3rd edition rules, which I think are the official rules now, so I'm pretty sure that's what the app uses too. (Someone can correct me if I'm wrong)

Farms are scored like this:
- the player with the majority influence (e.g. the most farmers) on a farm earns three points for every completed city touching that farm.
- cities can be scored more than once if they touch other farms.

Tema 201: Carcassonne: Is it cheating to use a tile distribution list reference?
Pregunta:
Player One says that it is cheating to use a tile distribution list (TDL)- a reference list of how many of each tile is used in the game. Player One says it is up to each player to memorize the quantities of each tile used in the game and rely upon their ability to keep track of used tiles in their head. Player One cites the example of not being able to use a cheat sheet in a casino.

Player Two says that a TDL is just a reference, like the Rules, even though there is no TDL included with the Rules. Player Two cites for example that Scrabble has a TDL printed right on the game board. If everyone can reference the TDL to make strategic decisions, especially later in the game, it provides no unfair advantage to any particular player.

Opinions?

This discussion is only about having a reference card that everyone shares, not individuals taking their own private notes (like in Clue) to keep track of tiles played, although that could also be discussed.

Respuesta 1:
My copy of the game (Big Box 3) came with a tile distribution list, separated out by by expansions. It's reference information that anyone can use.

Respuesta 2:
I would 100% say you can look at the list. You AREN'T playing in a casino and playing as if you were for every game you own would be really tiresome and take away from the fun of lots of games. In Vegas Blackjack you aren't allowed to touch the cards. Does player 1 touch his cards or does he bring a separate dealer to make sure no cheating is happening?

That all said when we play Carcassonne we use all of the expansions we have (3) and mix it all together, but since that makes for a really long game we take out about 1/3 of the tiles to keep the game shorter, but still allow all the expansions to get used. That would also stop your "problem" from exisiting.

Respuesta 3:
This really seems like something that is reasonable either way and up to the players to agree on.

Is player one being super-ultra-competitive, has memorised the tile distribution, and demands that this afford them the advantage that they deserve? Do they think that this is going to make other people want to play with them?

Respuesta 4:
Carcassonne rules that I have seen have a tile distribution list, at the very least which types of tiles are available.
There are players who have memorised that information anyway, so why not put everyone on an even keel?

Respuesta 5:
I can see how a tile reference might be useful if players have very different levels of experience (and my Big Box actually comes with one). However, if players at my table were constantly consulting the tile list and counting how many of each were already out, needlessly increasing downtime, I would be annoyed. I have a vague idea on how common each tile is, but memorizing the whole distribution or using a tile list is far beyond the level of competition that the game calls for.

Respuesta 6:
There's a very common misunderstanding of what tile distribution information is actually useful in Carcassonne. For instance let's say you know that there are 9 elbow roads - how often are you going to make a decision based on that?

What is useful is knowing which tiles are very rare or don't exist at all. This is the info you use when attempting to trap opponent meeples (which is fundamental to playing competitively). And it does not require much memorization at all. When playing with the base game and the first 2 expansions (as one should) there are just 3 configurations that are important to know:

1 Plunger tile (city at the top, road coming out the bottom)
1 Q-tile (city at the top, road coming out to the right)
No backwards-Q tiles (city at the top, road coming out to the left)

Respuesta 7:
The Carcassonne game app has a list of tiles available to players allowing for statistical decisions. Having a list also helps newer players where more seasoned players might be aware of the presence or absence of tile designs, multiples etc. We sometimes use a tile list therefore as a hsndicap for newer players.

Sadly, as of the 2014 edition (Carcassonne II) the tile manifests were taken out of at least the base game, Inns and Cathedrals, and Traders and Builders. At least on Z-man's website you can get a 3 page long tile manifest as they didn't keep it simple (yo!) and as such they have EACH variant of each tile type listed instead of grouping them together. Granted, Gardens and Abbots expansion and all, but they could have at least combined the non garden variants together! I hope with a good scan of the new tiles someone jumps on and makes a tile manifest for CarcII

The distributions are even updated as you go, so when the game draws near the end, you'll be able to see if the tiles you're looking for are grayed out, only have 1 left, etc.

If you've enable the option to show placements, it'll put an 'X' where no tile can ever go, letting you know that won't ever be a viable feature to complete.

Respuesta 10:
Carcassonne isn't a memory game, it's a tile laying game. So if someone can access a complete list of the tiles involved then fine. As long as it's equally available to all and it doesn't adversely affect the game (in terms of too much time spent counting on turns).
A player who says part of the game is to learn the tiles precisely and remember the numbers is fine to have done that, but is being elitist and childish in not allowing others to equal the playing field (not gain an advantage) by having this information available to them as well.

Respuesta 11:
I'd assume, if you ever play competitively, like in a tournament, it will never be allowed. However in private, it's up to the players and should just be something, to state an agreement.

Personally, neither I, nor my opponents ever used them, and yes, even I on occasions counted "elbow roads". This can be very important in endgame to determine, if a farmer has a chance to connect. A problem I have is, I quite frequently play with other addicts on JCZ. And while I'm by far not the most profound in tile counting there, I experienced last christmas vacation, that none of my family was any challenge for me in the game any more, just because I'm so much more familiar with tile distribution. So, this thread gave me the idea, it might be good, to distribute the reference table to my family opponents, next time, we get the game to the table.

It's not cheating.

I don't take gaming that seriously. While I have the tile type list more or less memorized, I don't expect anyone else to and if they ask if a tile exists I will gladly tell them to the best of my knowledge (I know the count of the rare ones, but not the common ones). If they insisted on looking it up online I would only be irritated if we had to take a break to do so.

Well, if there were 3 or 4 different locations a tile can go, would you begrudge a player if he tried out each one, and previewed how many points he'd score from each one, before committing to the one that scored him the most points?

Respuesta 16:
We use it when playing the base game, Its fun when you realize theirs only one possible piece that your friend can use to finish their city/road.... and they you draw it and stick it in the middle of no where. We get very competitive with the base game lol. Its also good to keep track of whats still available when placing pieces so you dont get your self into that situation.

Respuesta 17:
You said this was just about having a distribution list available. That alone I don't think is cheating and I would have no issue with it, as long as everyone is OK with it. After all, many games do include a list/pictures of what is available in the game, and when it doesn't exist, it's not unusual for me to find one (say, here ) that I can print and put in the game box.

I could see some more competitive groups not wanting to use it, and once you've reasonably learned the important stuff, some might think having such a list to be too easy. That is fine too, if that is what the group wants. I simple don't consider having the list as "cheating."

I could play with or without it. I have a rough drawing I made, but it's not in the game box so it doesn't get used for f2f games.

Now... if you want to get into the part about whether people can keep little cheat sheets and such, that's a different story. I know one guy whose group has bunches of copies and they actually mark off each tile as it's used, and that just kind of makes me want to puke.

I guess if everyone agrees, I wouldn't consider it cheating to make little quick notes, as long as you don't have a list of every tile and start checking them off. That feels like cheating. But let's say someone makes a quick count of some specific tile type, discovers 3 are left, and jots that down, I don't think I care about that. In fact, it would save time counting it again. I've never played this way though.

I will say there is something to be said for experience and learning tiles. Trevor might decide I'm being elitist, but I don't see it that way. I guess I just feel like my experience ought to be worth something. I don't personally play with any list or making any notes, not playing live anyway. I just expect I'm going to know the tiles better, just like someone who's played Ticket to Ride a gazillion times will know at least some routes, and I don't. That said, if someone asked me how many of this kind exist, I'd tell them if I knew. I just don't like the idea of having some list and actually marking them off as you go.

I don't completely agree with Player A or B, but I more agree with B. A list/picture shouldn't be something to take up a ton of time, and an experienced player could still use it to better advantage. A beginner is still a beginner, and experienced players will still have the advantage. Maybe Player A needs to think about that part.

You can take a card distribution list with you to a casino. As a start, in each deck of cards, there are 4 Aces, 4 2s, 4 3s,.......

I would say it is optional as to what the group likes to play with. My reasoning for this is it is optional in the app version of the game to turn on highlighting impossible locations, which means you would have to know the tile distribution to figure that out.

Use a chess clock set for, say, 20 seconds (or less) per move. This keeps the game going. If they miss the clock the tile goes back into the tile pool and they skip their turn. With 84 tiles, a game should take at most 28 minutes. Realistically, anything over 30 minutes is slow and ridiculous.

Any friend that has AP in Carcassonne is a dipshit, really.

Try this - at the start of the game randomly draw five tiles out of sight and keep them hidden and out of the game. Hopefully, it will create enough disparity between risk and reward as to render it not worthwhile to contemplate X number of moves ahead, or what the odds are on a certain tile being in the bag.



Tema 202: Carcassonne: how much is a road worth?


Tema 203: [Answered] Question: Any city, road, and field segments must continue segments already in play?
Pregunta:
I'm quite new to Carcassonne and I've been referencing the rules from the "Carcassonne Standard Complete Annotated Rules v7.4". On page 13, regarding tile placement, I'm stumped by the rule "Any city, road, and field segments must continue segments already in play." and the footnote "A cloister stands in the middle of a field segment and other segments can be placed next to it. In contrast to roads, cities, and fields, it is not possible to connect to a cloister."

1) This means I can connect a tile cloister tile surrounded by fields to any field?

2) What about cloisters with a road leading to it (and fields on three other sides)? Must I connect the side with the road with another existing road, since "Any city, road, and field segments must continue segments already in play."?

3) If a tile has both a road and a city section, I must connect both of them at the same time to existing tiles?

4) If (3) is false, does that mean I can just connect a field side to another existing field side, and let other segments (roads, cities) be exposed to empty space?

5) Does the cloister from Inns & Cathedrals with two roads and the cloister from Traders & Builders with three roads contradict the rule "In contrast to roads, cities, and fields, it is not possible to connect to a cloister."?

I hope I wasn't too confusing.

Don't read too much into it. You can boil it down to: When you place a tile it must connect to at least one previously placed tile, and relevant features must match up.

Respuesta 2:
Basically, the rules are saying, when you place a tile, any sides that connect to other tiles must match. Road to road, city to city, field to field.

You are not forced to match up anything on the tile you are placing. So if one edge has a road, another edge has a city, and the other two edges have a field, you can just connect one field edge to the board and leave the other sides open. You're never forced to continue any feature.

And the bit about cloisters just means that since cloisters are always on their own in the middle of a tile and not along an edge (the way a city, road, or field are) that you never connect directly to a cloister. So you never have to place a cloister tile next to another cloister tile (but you could if you wanted to).

Respuesta 3:
You're overthinking this. If you put the edges next to each other and they match so that the features continue smoothly across the two edges, it's allowed. If one edge has a road, castle o field, then they both have to. What's in the middle of the tile has no effect on matching at the edge.

Respuesta 4:
I think the key here can be really be expressed that pieces must connect to something, and be legal to place.

Any piece you place legally as long as it connects to the board connects to SOMETHING - a city, a field, or a road. A cloister is by definition one building in the middle of the field, so the cloister tile must be placed to connect to a field. Because it is a field, that has a building on it.

Does that help any?

And no, you are not under any obligation to link a partial city tile to a city -- you can link the field side of it to an empty field, potentially to create a new city. As you play the game more you'll find this an important strategy -- placing a city tile such that you can place your meeple on it because it is NOT connected to an existing city, in the hopes that you can later connect a city piece to in order to merge your one tile city with your opponent's multi-tile city, so you share points. Or, insidiously, do it twice so you steal the points entirely.

As noted, the only piece that you cannot place, score, and retrieve on the same turn are farmers. I presume you are talking about cloisters, btw?

And yes, as you get to play more you will try to find these opportunities. I always retain at least one me please to use for those instant points and never use it except for a SUPER compelling reason. It may not sound like a lot but every time you can put down a crossroads against another road with an end and instantly get a couple of points without having to lose your meeplemfor anything length of time adds up over the course of the game.

My wife is super lucky at drawing cloisters so I always try to avoid making spaces that are easy drop ins for them because she draws cloisters at way higher than what should be the statistical average.

Respuesta 7:
You can as long as the monastery fits the hole on all four sides of the tile.

Some monasteries don't have a road, so those would be surrounded completely by farms. Other monasteries have a road leading to them on their tile, and those need to be connected to a road on that side, and to farms on the other three sides of the tile.

Tema 205: 1-tile farmland
Pregunta:
Hello,

I'm new to Carcassonne and I didn't found an answer anywhere to this question.
On several expansions there is are tiles with four city and a little piece of farmland between them. So the farmland is no bigger than 1 tile.
Can you put a farmer onto that tile?

Respuesta 1:
Yep.

Respuesta 2:
Welcome to the geek.

Yes you can place a farmer onto that tile. The most it will score is 12 points, and that is only if the four city pieces on that tile become four individual completed cities.

Respuesta 3:
But on the other hand, that's 12 uncontested points, which is pretty good for a farm - you normally have to fight for them.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks everybody!

Respuesta 5:
Theoretically, if you use The Cathars, you can earn 24 points.

Respuesta 6:
Even more technically, you could have four castles for 16 points, I suppose...



Tema 206: Beginner question
Pregunta:
Hello, my fiance and I just recently got into board games. Among our first games we bought is Carcassonne. We just played tonight and enjoyed it. We seem to have a grasp on the rules of the basic game. One thing we were wondering is this, we had a rather large city being built and she had 2 meeples on it in different spots and I had one.

My question is... the city outlines were completed but it wasn't filled in and had empty spaces in it. Does this still score as a completed city with just the outline?

Also if I draw a monastery tile but choose to not place a meeple on it, is it possible for me or her to ever place a meeple on it later? Or can you only ever place your meeple on the tile you lay down each turn?

We both enjoyed the game and thank you for helping us!

Respuesta 1:
Even if the city is enclosed, it is not complete until all tiles are filled.

Re the Cloister (Monastry), a meeple can never be added later, only when first placing the tile.

A good resource, especially once you get expansions, is the Complete Annotated Rules found at the Carcassonne Central forum.

Respuesta 2:
Welcome to the joy of Carcassonne, and to BoardGameGeek too!

Andrew is correct. I also wanted to just add, just incase you didn't realise - if she had 2 meeples on a completed city and you only had 1, she'd get all the points (and you'd get none). You'd only both get the points if you both have the same number of meeples on the city.

Thanks for the quick answers everyone! We played again tonight and it went a lot smoother another question came up. I placed a tile that completed a short road and a city at the same time. I placed a meeple to get the city points and took it back. Can I then use a different follower to then claim the completed road and get him back?

Also I know when placing followers on cities there needs to be one space between you and your opponent. Does that also apply with your own? Could I have a follower on a city tile then place another city tile next to it and place a 2nd follower to have two side by side for the city?

The way you describe that action it gives me strong concern that you are playing incorrectly. Item 2 on Page 5 is about "Placing a Meeple"

You may not place a meeple in a feature where there already is at least one other meeple


You can't place a second pawn on a feature already occupied, no matter how far away (and no matter which player)

Careful study of the section "Many meeples in the same feature" on page 5 and 6, however, shows how features which are not connected may later become connected.

Hmm, I think we did play that incorrectly at one point. So once a city tile is placed and claimed, as long as tiles continue its wall no more followers can be put on that city. But if a wall is place and not connecte, a follower can claim it then later more tiles may connect the separate walls into the same city.

If that's correct then I believe we now fully understand the basic mechanics. We are both extremely new to board games in general and some directions confuse us at the beginning. Thanks again for the help!

I don't know if you're doing this wrong, but the wall is not the important part of the city, since sometimes different cities can share the same wall at a corner. The important thing is that the brown city areas with houses are not connected. Two tiles with city pieces that are diagonally adjacent, but don't have connected main parts can be claimed separately, even if it appears that their wall connects at the corner.

The Flying Machines is another expansion that allows meeples to be added to tiles that had been previously placed. By playing one of the special flying machine tiles, a meeple can be "flown" into any incomplete city, road, or monastery, even if it is already occupied by other meeples.

Respuesta 14:
Actually, if you have the Phantom expansion, then you can claim both features and get both, the regular meeple and the phantom meeple back.

The Phantom expansion gives each player a "ghost meeple". It counts as a regular meeple, but has the added ability of claiming a second feature on a just placed tile.

Yes, scoring happens afterwards.

1.You place a tile

If you have the current Z-Man rules then you will find affirmation of what you have already been doing on page 4, within a box titled "3. Scoring a city" that shows a specific example.

You now draw this tile that you place to continue your city. Since the tile you’ve placed completes a feature (here, the city), it must now be scored.


The example would be true for any feature.



Tema 207: Number of tiles with multiple expansions
Pregunta:
I kind of like the size of the original game. The number of tiles matches a good game that doesn't last too long in my opinion. Also, it nicely fits a standard table.

But with the expansions, the number of tiles increases. I think the game suffers from this.

How are you playing? Are you using all tiles? Are you removing a certain number of tiles? Are there any official directions on this?

What's your experience with the strategies above?

Thank you.

Respuesta 1:
With more than 2 players, IMHO the base set does not provide enough tiles for a decent game, so I usually use all tiles from all expansions. If we want a shorter game, we remove a certain amount of tiles randomly and play with the rest.

Hi. I like mega Carcassonne sessions, but moderating a little the number of tiles. I play with all base tiles + the half of each expansion I have. So, the game long tends to be doubled. The time limit idea above, without apart tiles, is also good. But this, like the other, allows more luck to the game. Selcting only the half of tiles, you can analyse and select tiles for a balanced game experience.

This is what we do too. In addition to the various spins offs we have, we also have the 10th anniversary edition that we keep as a separate basic game that we can pull out. It depends on the play group we have.

Respuesta 7:
I agree with Ron, that you need more tiles for more players. But I would never throw in the whole bunch, just add a few expansions to desire, and play them by the rule. The separation time after game is also worth the effort, if you have an edition with water marks.



Tema 208: Rules oddity in Devir Portuguese 2013 version? (Cloister tile placement)
Pregunta:
So I got down for a vanilla Carcassonne game in New Years Eve with a friend's copy. Turns out the cloister placement rules in his version say something like: cloister tiles can be placed anywhere since it is a self contained tile (with artwork in the center depicting a church) that you can play anywhere (except near cities). You can therefore play cloister tiles to finish roads even though there is no road actually on the general cloister tiles (another argument broke up when my friends didn't consider the cloister+road tike a cloister per se). This breaks up the imagery of the game and basically allows for fields to be joined in this way.

Also there are no clear references to laying meeples down on their sides for farms and the scoring is weird: rules stated 2 point per small city (pre 2005 rule) yet 3 points per supplied city (2005)...

Either this is a blunder of epic proportions or I am missing something very obvious...

Respuesta 1:
...those rules are profusely illustrated with examples contradicting the golden rule of the new land tile being played with all its land features fitting the adjacent terrain on all edges.

That surely sounds strange indeed. How can the translation be so messed up?
My original Carcassonne box is also a Devir Spanish/Portuguese edition from the early 2000's and lo and behold: it has that same flaw!

See both these examples:



[Red Border means tile just played] - The red player wins 3 points for completing the road.



After placing the new tile the farms of the three players are now connected. The player who placed this tile cannot place a farmer on it because the field segments connected already have farmers on them.


Edit: Nowhere do the rules mention that farmers are played laying down either...

Respuesta 4:
That's so bizarre. Does it still have some cloister tiles that have roads?

Respuesta 5:
This is not a mistake, this is an older rule. Some others also changed, like the 2 or 4 points per small cities (made by 2 segments). So yes, the rule must be the actual one, but the manual use an older example image. That's the mistake. That cloister tile would be one with a small road segment.

Respuesta 6:
Yes, both in mine and my friend's - 2 of them. Yesterday we didn't consider it a cloister because the artwork was different and because of this:

"...new land tile being played with all its land features fitting the adjacent terrain on all edges. (The cloisters are the only exception to this rule, because they aren't divided in several segments being complete in a single tile)."

This sentence - that isn't in any english or german rules I've seen - is what I believe started this 10 year old bug! I always considered the cloister + road a cloister for obvious reasons. But yesterday I couldn't reason with both "so why is the artwork different?" plus "the rules clearly state they aren't divided in several segments being complete in a single tile".

About the segments, cloisters are a single estructure, composed for the central tile and the 8 tiles surround it. In this way differs from roads and cities, that in fact have segments. Farms, like cloisters, doesn't have segments.

Ok, so what I believe you are telling me is that the sentence I thought was causing all the trouble is correct - despite being redundant for gameplay and misleading.

If so do you happen to know when did the cloisters started being played according to the "with all its land features fitting the adjacent terrain on all edges" rule and stopped being played wrongly like the image below?

Doing a quick search on the uploaded files for Carcassonne I found two very enlightening documents from 2004 and 2006. Both I suppose were translated from an English or German original pdf (which I couldn't find). The first one is a Catalan (labeled "official") translation. Please note that the mistake remains.

Tema 209: Abbot clarification?
Pregunta:
We received Carcassonne for Christmas and we've been playing a lot, but the abbot rules seem unclear. They say, "When placing a tile with a monastery or a garden, you may place either a meeple or your abbot. The meeple is placed as usual whereas the abbot must be placed on the monastery or garden you’ve just placed." This seems to imply that a meeple could be placed on a tile that you haven't just placed, but an abbot has to be placed on the tile you've just placed. But we thought meeples could only be placed on the tile you just placed. Clarification? We get that abbots can only go on the monastery or garden. Thanks!

The regular, non-Abbot meeples also have to be played on the tile you just placed since that would be "as usual." I think they worded it that way because you could still place a regular meeple on a road/farm/city part of that tile instead, but the Abbot has to go on the monastary or garden.

Respuesta 2:
If placing a tile you may place a meeple on it, whether this may be a normal meeple or an abbot.
As your abbot can only be place on cloisters and gardens, it can also be token back when you think it will not be possible to score more points at that feature.(this is instead of placing wood(a meeple)).

So with that it can also strength your game, for taking more points if used smart.

Respuesta 3:
It is golden rule of any Carcassonne game that meeple can be put only on the tile just placed.
Well, not so golden, since there are some expansions (fliers, portals) that allows to place somewhere else. In those rare cases it is very clearly stated and explained how to determine where you can put your meeple.
Welcome to the Carcassonne!

Tema 211: Road scoring
Pregunta:
Just bought and played my first game of Carcassonne. Had a question about scoring roads. How is it scored if the road is circular and ends at it's own starting point? Do you count each tile only once, or does the starting/ending tile get counted twice because it contains 2 sections of the road that has been scored?

I was scoring it twice but now I'm not so sure. Thanks for any help.

Each tile of a road scores only one time, even if you use two different road segments on the same tile.

From the older Rio Grande rules (my highlight)

A COMPLETED ROAD
A road is complete when the road segments on both ends connect to a crossing, a city segment, or a cloister, or when the road forms a complete loop. There may be many road segments between the ends.

The player who has a thief on a completed road scores one point for each tile in the completed road (count the number of tiles; separate segments on a tile count just once).


There is nothing special about a loop.

Tema 212: Abbot in Carcassone
Pregunta:
If you decide to take back the abbot before all the surrounding tiles have been placed ( the abbot's special power)and gain a reduced number of points can someone else place their abbot on the garden or monastery straight away when it's their turn as it has no longer been 'claimed' - if they could then you could have a situation every couple of turns where various players just use this to pick up a few points. I couldn't see anything in the rules about it. I suppose they must be able to do this as there is now easy way of seeing which garden or monastery has been used until it's fully surrounded.

Also, I've read contradictory advice on whether or not it's only abbots that can be placed on gardens. I know the abbot or a follower can be placed on a monastery but can a follower be placed on a garden as well as an abbot?

Tema 213: Multiple Followers - have I been scoring wrongly.
Pregunta:
Hello,

I think I may have been scoring wrongly all this time, but I prefer the way I have been doing it!

Currently we play that if 2 or more followers on a road, city or farm join up during game that the player (with most meeples) scores points for each follower rather than just to determine who wins a contested feature.

For example a player joins 2 separately claimed roads which form 1 long road, Instead of scoring 1 point for each road tile they score 2 because they have 2 followers on the completed feature. Playing this way allows for clever strategy to gain more points as well as wipe out other players. It is great for farmers too as you can really mess people up with lots of sneaky farmers clocking up points in a mega field.

I know that the big meeple and meeples on hills (Hills & Sheep) only count as 1 meeple for scoring but are the power of 2 for determining contested features - we still play this way.

I just started playing the Android app version and noticed that multiple meeples don't contribute to a bigger score. So I assume I have been scoring wrongly all this time.... but I don't think I will change as I really like the way we score!

Please can you confirm the 'official' rules and also does anyone else play/score the way I have been doing?

Thanks

Well the thread was about clarifying the official rules so I thought this was the appropriate thread.If necessary the mods can move the thread. Sorry if it is in the wrong location.

As for the scoring it pushes your opponent to invest in a feature and find different ways to secure it. Our group has never had any issues or imbalances playing this way as it has made all players play more strategically.

Respuesta 7:
Scoring for every meeple in a feature would certainly encourage building big cities with as many meeples in them as you can afford. How have you managed to avoid this?

Respuesta 8:
James
@BC2014
Please can you confirm the 'official' rules and also does anyone else play/score the way I have been doing?
A simple way to confirm is to check a copy of the printed rules. Here is a quote from page 5 of the current Z-Man rules with pretty explicit wording.

* If there are multiple meeples in a single scored feature, the player with the most meeples is awarded full points and all other players receive nothing. When more than one player have the most meeples in a scored feature, the tied players all score full points.


EDIT:
The earlier Rio Grande rules did not make it stand out in a summary section as done by Z-Man, yet it is just as clear,


What if a completed city or road has more than one follower?
It is possible through clever placement of land tiles for there to be more than one thief on a road or more than one knight in a city. In a completed road or city, the player with the most thieves (on a road) or the most knights (in a city) earns all the points. When two or more players tie with the most thieves or knights, they each earn the total points for the road or city.

If you like the intensity of competition for big point swings, try adding the Inns & Cathedrals  expansion. These features make roads & cities more valuable (but worth points only if completed); also the big meeple encourages that kind of competition.

Yes, you are playing it wrong.

This seems like it would encourage players to play on their own side of the board and play multi-player solitaire games of getting the most meeples on their own structures.

Additionally the incentive to put many meeples into their structures would make it a waste of time for opponents to try to horn in--further promoting player isolation.

Overall it seems like your variant would create a game about puzzling out how to connect your meeples to each other instead of a game about how to connect your meeples to your opponents'. Less player interaction is always bad in my opinion.

The large meeple and hills counting differently for determining control and determining score is not part of the game, but another result of your variant as the number of meeple in a feature has no barring on the value of that feature.

Only a large meeple on a hill counts as two because it always counts as two. A regular meeple on a hill is still, just one meeple. Hills don't add virtual meeple to a feature. A player with a meeple in a feature and on a hill, wins ties amongst players that have an equal number of meeple in that feature.

I guess I didn't word it correctly. We are playing exactly as you state above in regard to big meeples and meeples on hills.

What I meant was that placing a meeple on a hill only has the value of 1 meeple for scoring purposes, but in our circle we describe it as having the power of 2 meeples (or 1.5 if you like) when determining who wins in a tie and who gets knocked out.

The player still only receives the points for 1 meeple. It is a matter of the words and description we use rather than actually playing that rule differently.

Value = score
Power = who wins in a tie.

The same applies to big meeple in cities, roads and farms.



Tema 214: Abbot?
Pregunta:
I just bought the new edition for my nephew and noticed it comes with the river, which is nice, and abbots.

Since it's a present I can't open it to peek at the rules. Can anyone let me know what the abbot meeple does in the new edition.

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
The abbot can be placed in a cloister/monastery (just as if he was a monk), or he can be placed in a garden (several tiles in the game have little flowerbeds within the 'field' portion).

In either location abbots act exactly like monks except for the fact that they can be removed/scored before all eight surrounding tiles have been placed. If, on a turn, you choose not to place a meeple, you can instead remove the abbot and gain points based on how many tiles were surrounding it (i.e. 2 to 9 points).

It's a fun little addition - I have the same version you got for your nephew, and we have just made the abbot a default inclusion in any game we play

Respuesta 2:
Thanks Matthew

Respuesta 3:

Tema 215: Earn Feature - No Meeples
Pregunta:
Hi,

I have probably a really dumb question. Sorry if this has already been answered, as I couldn't find my answer.

Once a tile is placed and the player placing the tile doesn't decide to place a meeple on that tile, can the other players then place a meeple on other player tiles during their turn? It doesn't really explain this in the rules, from what I could see. I assume you can – but just thought I would ask. From my perspective it would seem quite silly if you couldn't I guess.

I say this because at one stage all of our meeples were on tiles. We were completing features that one could claim, due to the lack of meeples. But we weren't sure once meeples were available if they could be claimed at a later stage, either by the tile placer or other players.

Thanks in advance for the clarification.

Respuesta 1:
You can only place a meeple (a follower, if you want to stick to the terminology in the rule book) during your own turn, on the tile you just placed. You cannot place a meeple during someone else's turn, and you cannot place a meeple on any tile other than the one you just placed.

Respuesta 2:
OK.

Thanks for the reply. So to be clear you can only place meeples on tiles you place during your turn.

If for any reason you don't place meeples on a tile, you or the other players cannot place a meeple on your placed tiles, during their turn.

Again to re clarify we had an in stance last night that none of the players had any remaining meeples. Entire features were being completed. So as you have suggested these would become non-gain able features never to be scored.

Technically yes. You can only gain points for a feature if you have a meeple/follower on it when the feature is completed. If you find yourself constantly running out of meeples then you need to re-think your strategy a bit to try and conserve them throughout the game.

You need to have a balance of meeples that can not return to your possession and stay out on the field (i.e. farmers), and meeples that return to you once the feature is complete (i.e. knights in cities, robbers on roads, or monks in cloisters). Is it possible that you aren't playing correctly? - are you returning meeples on roads/cities/cloisters to your possession after the feature is completed?

Respuesta 5:
Also, welcome to BGG no1bossman!

And if Carcassonne is one of your first modern/designer/hobby board games, then welcome to the hobby as well!

Respuesta 6:
There may still be benefits to completing the features even if you do not have meeples to place for influence. If you leave something open just because you have no meeple to place, then you are leaving it open for someone else. If your opponent is controlling the farming, then you would want to complete roads to minimize their reach. If you are controlling the farming, then you would want to complete small cities to set yourself up for more points in final scoring.

Hi all,

Sorry I am new and I have a quick question. I tried to browse the forum but I didn't find an exact answer:

If I place a tile that completes a feature where I already have a meeple, can I put my meeple on another feature of the same tile and at the same time score the previous feature and take the other meeple back? Ex:

tile with road and city. The city part closes a city that already has my meeple. I place my new meeple on the road and remove the other meeple to score the city. Is this ok?

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
You place meeples before scoring completed features. So in your example, you're fine. Basically, you lay a tile, place a meeple on any unclaimed feature for this tile, score any features the tile completes.

Respuesta 2:
You should keep to the following order strictly - it solves these problems:

0. Place a tile
1. Place a single meeple on the tile just played (Optional)
2. Score any completed features
3. Take back meeples from any completed features

You cannot play meeples that you got back on your current turn - the above order stops it happening.

From your description, you played the rules correctly.

Tema 217: Mix n Match Expansions
Pregunta:
We've started to play Carcassonne with several different expansions. As we add in different ones, some questions have come up about what to do in certain situations. Now, as long as we do the same thing each time, I don't think it really matters in the grand scheme of things, but it would be good to get the general consensus or indeed the official word on the following:

Wheel of Fate and Bridges, Castles & Bazaars:

Do castles count as cities on the taxation space on the wheel of fate? Do they count towards scoring the fields on the famine space as well?


Bridges, Castles & Bazaars and Hills & Shepherds:

If you play a tile from a bazaar auction that extends your shepherd's field, do you draw a sheep tile/bring the flock in?


Bridges, Castles & Bazaars and Inns & Builders:

I play a bazaar tile in my builder city/road - what happens first; the auction or my second tile placement?


Hills & Shepherds & Inns & Cathedrals:

Who wins a majority in a field with:
Fat meeple on a hill vs a meeple on a hill and a meeple?
Fat meeple vs meeple on a hill?
Fat meeple and meeple vs meeple on a hill and meeple?

No. While the Follower there is still considered a Knight, the Castle is not a City. As such the Knight is not able to score it.

Stuart McLagan
@Spikethdee
Do they count towards scoring the fields on the famine space as well?
Yes. The Farmers gets to score according to end-game scoring, which would allow points for the Castle on the farm. As a Castle scores 1 more than a City at end-game, for Famine he would also score 1 more than a City, so 2 points.

Stuart McLagan
@Spikethdee
If you play a tile from a bazaar auction that extends your shepherd's field, do you draw a sheep tile/bring the flock in?
Yes. When you play the tile you acquired in an auction, you play it as a normal turn. The exception to this is if you should acquire an auction tile in the auction, or draw one during the play of your acquired auction tile, say, as a draw granted by your builder, the auction on that new tile is ignored until after the current auction is resolved.

...if I place a tile acquired in an auction on a builder city/ road, I get to place another tile, have I understood that correctly?
Yes, that is correct. The tile you acquire at auction is played as a regular turn. The exception to that is if you should draw an auction tile as a result of builder draw, while playing your auction acquired tile, the pending new auction is suspended until the current auction is resolved.

We got the corn circle expansion a few weeks ago and another couple of questions have appeared:

I've got a meeple on the tile that has a monestary in a city. If I get the city corn circle, can I add a meeple to that tile as a monk, or just a knight?

I've only got my fat meeple left, can I place this, rather than a regular meeple?

Even though the monastery is depicted "in" the city they are two separate features. If your previously placed meeple is a knight in the city, then you may place your additional meeple as another knight with it on the same tile, in the same city. If the previously placed meeple is a monk in the monastery, you may not place an additional meeple with it.

Yes, the large meeple may be placed this way.

Crop circles only allow you to place a Farmer, Thief, or Knight. It doesn't matter where the monastery is, you can't place a Monk with a crop circle.

Tema 218: Mayor and Castle - CAR inconsistency
Pregunta:
I'm having trouble figuring out how mayors and castles interact. There's one footnote:

page 60, footnote 161
wrote:
The mayor cannot be placed in a castle
Then there's this statement:

page 100
wrote:
A player can use the wagon to build a castle. If a mayor is on the castle, it does not earn points for the castle, because there is never a pennant there.
These two are clearly contradictory, and there's a third case that is not described in the rules. What if you have a mayor on a semicircle, and then complete that city with another semicircle?

* Can you turn it into a castle?
* If you can, then what do you do with the mayor?
* If the mayor has to be removed, can you replace it with a regular meeple from your supply?

Respuesta 1:
It's not a contradiction. You cannot place a Mayor on a Castle, but you can place a Mayor on a City tile that has no pennant. If that city becomes a Castle (by completing it with a second tile) then the Mayor stays, but cannot score for it. A Wagon, meanwhile, acts as a Follower for all scoring purposes and, therefore, can be placed on a Castle as a normal Follower.

It can't be removed voluntarily unless another expansion allows it to be removed, and it cannot be replaced unless it becomes vacant somehow. Numerous expansions could help make it vacant, and both the Flier and Magic Portals (from Princess & Dragon) could then be used to reclaim it using a different Follower.

Respuesta 2:
That clears up a lot, but not everything.

Why does it even say that you can't place a mayor on a castle? You can't place anything on a castle. Follower placement happens before you turn it into a castle. After building the castle, the pre-existing follower is moved on top of the castle.

Respuesta 3:
I think the refer to other expansions, like magic portals and so on. In that case it could be that there is a castle and that it is unoccupied and uncompleted and hence you can place a follower there.

It's never been clear to me, and I believe it's inadequately addressed in the rules and the CAR, as to what constitutes an incomplete Castle.

If it's vacant and any one of the features in the vicinity has been completed, is it complete? Or is it incomplete so that it can be occupied again?

You would instinctively answer, "Well, was the feature completed before or after the Castle was built?". Makes sense. But what if it came up an hour or two after the Castle became incomplete? Who is to specifically remember when any of the features around that particular Castle were completed? Who's going to be able to say that in fact the Castle wasn't scored already and that's why it's unoccupied? Maybe it was the one right next to it?

Because of this we have house-ruled that if any of the features in the vicinity are complete, regardless of when, the Castle is complete for future considerations and cannot be occupied or re-occupied. Then there is no reliance on memory and no chance for disruption or argument.

The case will arise that someone will attempt to occupy a Castle on the very next turn that someone decides not to when it was built. That is an extreme example but the rule has to be enforced one way or another.

Magic Portal and Flier won't work for claiming a Castle. They can be used to take features on a specific tile, but the Castle is not on any one specific tile. I don't think an empty Castle can be claimed later.

Good point. That would also correct the issue with how to determine when an unclaimed Castle is "completed". But Castles can still can be claimed when they are created (either by moving a Follower from the half-City or by placing a Follower on it once upgraded). I suppose the "Mayor can't be placed" rules applies to the latter situation, since a Mayor apparently can be transferred to a Castle.

This is a good point that we've never considered in our games. It's a good solution to the timing issue I described. You have to hold that the Flier and Magic Portal allow entry onto a specific tile first, then a specific feature. This would bar entry into a Castle as it is not on a specific tile. I like it.

Tema 219: Princess and the builder

Anyways the question I have is. When you connect a tile with the princess. And it is your own city and you have 1 meeple and the builder in it.
The princess removes the meeple, which subsequently means the builder also get's removed. The question now though, do you still get an extra turn or not, to pick up another tile.

You do, because in the strict sense you extended a feature that contained your builder. That condition was met before the builder was removed.

Respuesta 2:
I agree that you take an extra (Builder) turn in this situation.

You might want to take a look at the CAR 7.4 in can be found in the files section and has the most up-to-date comprehensive rules. You'll see that while some editions are still being published with the old rule for the Princess tiles, that there is errata now making the removal of a knight from a city optional instead of mandatory when adding a Princess tile.

Fun house rule, but if you don't have a follower there do you allow that someone else can just claim the city by placing a follower directly into it?

Respuesta 5:
Yes, as the builder is not considered a claiming meeple. If you help a city in which your builder is, but it is not claimed by you, you still get the extra turn.

We some similar thing for the pig, and thereby you can control the dragon to eat your pig or you have some extra reason to get your farm back once you lost control.

We used this rule, as we did not know that you are allowed to remove the builder once you lose control. It was this thread that pointed me to that rule.



Tema 220: Flying Machine follower lands on a lake tile from Ferries, now what?
Pregunta:
We had a situation where yellow managed to use a flying machine to land on a lake piece with an unfinished road, and were wondering if this would allow yellow to move the ferry to a different position.



Strictly speaking a ferry can only be moved when the road is extended, but this particular combination of moves makes me wonder if it has been considered that a road could be a part of an active player's move without it being extended.

Since a follower is placed onto a lake piece, I was inclined to use the steps concerning lake placement (the only other case I know where a follower is placed onto a lake piece). The rest of the table argued against me.

Any thoughts?

Respuesta 1:
In cases like this, I like to use the hidden gem that are the Carcassonne Complete Annotated Rules. A .pdf-file with more than 300 pages in which the many interactions between expansions are thoroughly described and interpreted through multiple FAQ's and forum questions, etc.

Anyhow...

My thoughts:

- As you say, the ferry only gets moved when a road ending up at the lake gets extended. This is not the case here. Note that the road that gets extended needs to have a ferry already on it in order for you to be able to move that ferry. This isn't the case in the picture.

- The road that the yellow meeple lands on, is actually finished, as it has an end point at the city gates and one in the lake. This actually means that the yellow meeple can't even be placed there. As the follower launched with the flying machine may only be placed on an unfinished feature.

So I think that the rest of the table had it right.

EDIT: You could legally land on the road with the grey meeple though. But still wouldn't get to move the ferry in that case.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks. I did check the CAR, which led me to conclude that an extension of the rule is most likely the only case in which you can move the ferry.

The CAR actually lists a "sequence of actions relating to lakes and ferries", which is quite an arbitrary description.

Quote:
1. Place (lake) tile
2. Place follower
3. Place ferry (if new lake tile placed) [366]
4. Move ferries on other lakes (if placed tile extends a ferry road) [367]
5. Score features (if needed)

[366] The RGG version of the rules incorrectly adds “if he placed a follower on the road” here, even though there is no such stipulation in the body of the rules.
[367] The RGG version of the rules incorrectly adds the requirement “if he placed a follower on the road” here, even though there is no such stipulation in the body of the rules.
The RGG version rule footnotes would allow me to extend the road just by placing a follower onto the road (as per my problem case). These were not included in the CAR because (presumably) it was read as though you would have to extend the road as well as place a follower on it, in order to move the ferry. In my opinion, either one could be a trigger that allows a player to move the ferry.

Respuesta 3:
I think the RGG version means to say that the road to the lake should be extened and a meeple placed on the extension in order for the ferry to be allowed to move, which would mean that just adding a road tile to the road leading to the ferry wouldn't trigger the moving of that ferry.

The above was an unnecessary addition, as indicated by the incorrectly in the CAR.

The original German rules state the following:

Quote:
Legt der Spieler seine Landschaftskarte an eine Straße an, die eine Fähre als Teil hat, darf er diese Fähre nun umlegen. Er darf diese Fähre beliebig umlegen, muss dies jedoch nicht.
So the only thing that triggers the moving of a ferry is when a tile gets placed that lengthens the road of which the ferry is a part. Nowhere in these rules does a meeple play any part.

To clarify further, yellow would have no choice but to add his meeple to the road that is occupied by gray. He has to play his meeple on an incomplete feature on that tile if at all possible, and that is his only option.



Tema 221: Is this field blocked by two cities?
Pregunta:
This came up tonight.

The overwhelming majority of city tiles have the graphic drawn right to the corners. There appears to be a few that are slightly not touching the corner.

In fact, if two tiles come together where one touches the corner and the other doesn't, it still cuts off the field.

It was only in this instance where two graphics, with each having cities that didn't touch the corners, did the issue arise.

Here's the picture:



So: is the field cut off or not where I have drawn the red circle?

My base game certainly doesn't have a tile like that. I don't have the other expansion, but I still bet it is a printing error. Weird that you have two printing errors on different games though.

Respuesta 7:

It might not be up to date, but if you look at the Bridges, Castles and Bazaars expansion tile distribution in the CAR v5.0, none of the tiles shown there display this gap:

I would take good close-up photos of these tiles and email them to your version's publisher's Customer Services and ask for replacements.

Respuesta 8:
Funny to see this though

Respuesta 9:
This is definitely a situation where you should trust mechanics over graphics. If a tile side has an exposed building edge, then that whole edge is blocked. There's no such thing as a 'half-building edge' (at least not in the base game as it stands anyway).
Each side of a tile is just one thing, field/road/castle, then it might have a monastery in the middle.

Respuesta 10:
The cities should be right into the corner, but fortunately your circle is cutting off the farm instead.

Do you score a bonus for farms with an arrow in them?

Respuesta 11:
Very odd indeed, and definitely a misprint. The tiles are printed in sheets, so if one is misaligned there should be others from that same sheet. I noticed the half city tile in the upper left of your photo is also misaligned to some degree. Are all of your tiles from a particular Big Box set?

Respuesta 12:
The funny thing is that even if the tiles were misaligned, these potentially misaligned tiles with roads line up with the aligned tiles with roads perfectly.

It really doesn't make any sense. I conclude that I must have the Monsanto edition, where the farms are much larger than they should be.

Tema 222: Has the way the Knight is played changed?
Pregunta:
Hello,

I borrowed an older copy of Carcassonne to play with my Girlfriend and, since she enjoyed it, I went ahead a bought a copy. I now have the newest edition (the one that comes with the River and the Abbott mini expansions).

However I am confused. I remember being able to play multiple knights into a city in previous editions as long as they were not next to each other. However reading the rules for this version it seems like you can only ever play one knight into a city (but of course you can link two cities together to make one giant city with more than one knight).

Am I right in thinking this rule has changed or did I misread some of the rules?

Which rule is correct?

Correct. I could have clarified by stating "incomplete, or just completed". But my statement was not an attempt to override the normal rule for placement of Followers on one's turn. There is technical logic that posits that a Feature is incomplete until scored (or rather only considered to be complete once the scoring phase of the turn is reached), in which case the placement of a Follower occurs before the Feature is complete - hence the ability to place a Follower on a Feature completed by the very played tile.



Tema 223: So, is it official? "Edge of the World"
Pregunta:
So, is it? Is there an official ruling on this?

If not, anyone who plays or has played in the Major Tournaments can say how it is done in those tournaments? Is there an official amount of play space that is permitted/required/regulated for official play? How do they do it in the World Tournament?

Looking forward to knowledgeable responses. We can argue semantics of what "play on the table" means and what it does not. But I really do not care about the semantics. I would love an official ruling.

I'm not sure how Official this is but it is taken from http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/87531/carcassonne-standard... page 25 (bold added by me for emphasis):

Quote:
Use of a Table
A number of questions have been asked about rules related to the play area itself,
including what happens when the edge of the area is reached, or if a table has to be used
for play. The following clarifications are from Georg Wild from HiG (5/2013):
 The edge of the table is the limit for the game if, as stated in the rules, a table is
used.
 The rules state that the starting tile is placed in the middle of the table. If all of the
tiles are shifted to allow more room, the starting tile would no longer be in the
middle. So in principle, total shifting of the tiles is not allowed. Additionally, with a
manual shift of all of the tiles, the tiles and figures on the field can slip, which
could lead to incorrect positioning of tiles or figures.
 Addition of a second table is possible if one of an appropriate height is added to the
first table. If a table is extended (as with an additional panel), make sure that the
tiles and figures on the playing field do not slip.
 Playing on the floor: The rules technically do not allow this, because the rules state
that the first tile is placed in the middle of the table. Playing on the floor is not
forbidden, however, if use of a table is not feasible. If the floor is used, tiles must
be placed so all tiles are visible to all players. Tiles cannot be placed under the
sofa, cabinet/shelf, etc.
 It is important generally, that all the players in the round agree how to play:
Table - Standard
Table - with "total shifting" of tiles
Table - with extension
Floor
 Continue to play fairly and not intentionally unfair to other players.

Respuesta 2:

I have added an extra bolded statement to my first reply. Players should agree beforehand. I would say that adding tables mid-game would not be allowed, unless mentioned beforehand but putting multiple tables together before the start of the game would be fine.

I run "friendly" tournament events. I had an event and I just thought it was "known" that the "edge of the table" is not playable. One participant said it is not in the rules. Depending on how one determines "places it on the table" is interpreted. Also, Hunters & Gatherers does specifically state that the edge of the table is the edge of the playable area.

The player who wanted to place a tile laid the tile down. It was half off the board. It was barely stayed on the board. At that point we had played about thirty tiles. I ruled that it was unplayable. I was given grief about it.

I just am surprised that in a game that has some history is a popular game to play online and has, from what I understand, a pretty solid World Championship event has not explicitly stated an official ruling.

You run the tournament so you get to decide on issues that are not covered in the rulebook. No one likes the referee but you can't have a game without one.

You simply now need to state how you interpret the rule: so are you saying that 100% of the tile must be on the table surface? Just decide which way you will go and ensure everyone knows.

I suggest that you give yourself a "my decisions are final" kind of rule.

In the rules of Hunters and Gatherers, it clearly states that the edge of the table is the end of the playing area. Under Drawing and placing land times:

The player must place the new land tile with or more of its sides adjacent to a previously placed land tile. He may not place the land tile so it touches previously placed tiles only corner to corner. The edge of the table limits the playing area. . .. .


This is pretty explicit. Why you want to counter this so much Tomello fascinates me. Look, while playing the game in a friendly environment do what you want.

Actually, it only states this in the RGG version of the rules. The Z-Man version does NOT state this and so it could be argued that with Z-Man being the newer version, it is the more correct version. So while explicit in one, the lack of it in another puts the whole official stance in question.

Ahh.OK then.

Before my earlier posting I consulted the rules as published with the new source, Z-Man Games. The precision you state does not exist there.

The same section now says more simply,

1. Placing a Land tile
A player must first draw a Land tile from one of the facedown piles. She may show it to all players (who may advise her of good placement opportunities), and then place it according to the following rules:
*The newly placed tile (red-bordered in the examples below) must be placed adjacent to at least one existing tile. Diagonal adjacency is not sufficient.
• Meadows, rivers, and forests must continue from this newly placed tile to existing adjacent tiles.

Given your latest response I did search for the older Rio Grande Games rules and do find a match as you present.

With the difference between those two passages in mind I would have to say that what you presently rely upon as "official" has not been very enduring, although that does not make it wrong.

And yes, every event could be different. House rules are not unheard of.

The document I linked to in my first reply documents a truck load of House Rules, along with the actual rules. The attitude seems to be "these are the rules, but if you want to play differently then go for it (as long as you tell people)".

I mean with regards to feature completion? In other words if for example I have a road starting form let's say a cloister several tiles furhter in the table and leading to an open side (like in a tile with just a straight road segment and farm -- green -- on both sides) of a tile basically bordering with the table, would that road be complete? As if the "no lay zone" determined by not enough room on the table were a city wall or something? Man, I hope that was clear :what:

Respuesta 24:
No, features are only completed if a tile completes them. You can't complete anything by touching the edge of the play area.



Tema 224: Three rule questions
Pregunta:
We played with farms for the first time today, and three questions came up, although one wasn't directly about farms! We have the new style base game, with the river and abbot mini expansions.

1. We were laying the river tiles and the river had turned in such a way that it was impossible to play the lake tile legally - there was a road that wouldn't have joined up if we placed it where the river joined the lake. Did we do something wrong, or should we have re-placed one of the river tiles to make the lake fit or should we have just left the lake Unplayed? (I know that's sort of three questions, but I'm only counting it as one!!)

2. Does the river count as a field boundary? We played that it didn't, as the rules say just cities and roads, but just wanted to make sure.

3. What about unfinished fields? We had a field that "went through" a space on the map. It could have continued, or it could have had a road cutting it off (an adjacent tile had a road tile, so the road could have cut right across the field or turned down the way and kept the field open. What is the correct way to score this?

Many thanks in advance!!

My copy of the rules specifies that the river cannot make a "U-turn", which I think must have happened for you to end up in this situation. So I would say that someone must have placed a tile illegally before this point, causing a U-turn.

If there isn't a tile, there isn't anything. The fields end at the edge of the tile and do not "go through" empty space.

Respuesta 2:
I just looked again at the river and I think we did indeed make a u-turn by accident (well, my wife did, so it's her fault!!)

So, if the only way that a field could possibly touch a city is through a blank space, you score nothing??

If there is a blank space, it's not touching. Therefore no score.

Respuesta 4:
1) River tiles are never allowed to touch other river tiles, so you cannot place the turns in such a way as to make this happen. If the river turns twice in a row, it must end going in the same direction it started, like an S, not a U.

2) Yes, the river is a farm boundary.

3) If the tile isn't there, the field does not go through it, even if it looks like it "should". Fields separated by empty space are separate. If you can trace a way around the empty space and connect the fields that way, you're fine. Otherwise, they're not the same field.

Respuesta 5:
1: You must put aside the lage tile, it must be the last one played and the player who do this will play the first regular tile from the game.

Thanks for the prompt replies (as ever!!). We've made sure that we play the river correctly from now on, and are using the river as a field boundary.

They will certainly be playable but the art is different.

Respuesta 12:
We have a modified house rule on the river: Figuring the reason for the U-turn rule is the potential for exactly what you encountered:

Stuart McLagan
@Spikethdee
the river had turned in such a way that it was impossible to play the lake tile legally - there was a road that wouldn't have joined up if we placed it where the river joined the lake.
... we decided that the rule should be: You cannot place a river tile in such a way that the next tile would be touching any tiles other than the river tile just placed. So IMMEDIATE U-turns are illegal, but two right turns (for example) with one or more straight river tiles between them is fine, and the only other illegal play would be three turns in the same direction, driving the river back into itself.

Respuesta 13:
I think one of the rules files for The River Expansion clarifies a couple of rules well: No U-turns are allowed and a U turn after 1 turn and a single straight river might muck things up a bit but you should see within your group if you would allow that. Also, it states that the person who plays the lake gets the original starting tile (1 city, 1 straight road, 1 field) to play on their turn as well as a normal turn as a possible rule variant (can place a meeple and/or score if the city side completes a city added by the river)

Tema 225: Using two copies of Carcassonne to play but what about the expansions ?
Pregunta:
I've just received the Big Box 5 and a standard copy of Carcassonne and I was hoping somebody may have some experience in playing with two copies at once.

I was a little confused as to whether the expansions still make sense with two base copies of the game though.

I have two copies of the River expansion so I suppose it would be okay to set up the game using them both, or would that screw things up?

This could get quite complex...

Is there a forum I have missed that specifically talks about using two copies and adding in expansions?

(I have been looking through so many pages now that my head is spinning).

Respuesta 1:
Basically yes to all of the above.

It really depends on the game you want to play. If you put all of the big box plus the second base game, my guess is you are almost at a 2.5 to 3 hour game.

I love mega game but my preference is to include more expansions rather than another base game. This will add more variety to keep a long game more interesting.

I would suggest this dedicated English speaking Carcassonne site for all you want to know. http://www.carcassonnecentral.com/community/index.php

Respuesta 2:
Many expansions are mini expansions with 4-8 tiles only. They have little impact on the game with single base copy, it won't make a difference if you use two copies.

As for big expansions (18+ tiles), some of them get diluted with 2 copies (Tower, Princess and Dragon), while the others (Inns & Cathedrals, Traders and Builders) are still OK. However if you add to many big expansions to only 1 base game copy, the game seems out of balance. I don't think you should get 2 copies of every expansion. Just throw in more expansions. I recommend using 2 base game copies in 2 situations:

(i) you want to add many (3+) big expansions to your game at once

(ii) you want to play with more than 6 players

Respuesta 3:
I have played numerous double set games and it is always a blast. The only catch is make sure that you have enough time to complete it. The last one I played, we started at 11PM and completed at around 5AM. I was away on vacation with friends then.

We use the old scoring rules. We like those better.

We play with the following expansions x2:

Base Set
I&C
T&B
A&M
K&S
Magazine Pieces
10th Anniversary
Cult & Siege tiles
The 4 regular tiles from Bridges, Castles and Bazaars.
And a combination of both Rivers.

This is about 190 total tiles per set, so 380 for the double set game

The answer is No, just as would be true with any other feature.

(quote from new Z-Man rules)

• The player may not place her follower on a road, in a city or in a field if that section is connected to another tile where there already is a follower (no matter which player owns that follower).

Respuesta 4:
Neither you nor an opponent can place a farmer where one already exists.

Here is an example of how you get into someone else farming business.

Photo #1, the fields are separate and can be farmed.



Photo #2, if the connecting tile is placed as shown the two separate farms are now joined.

Tema 227: Neighbouring monasteries
Pregunta:
Just played our first few games today!!

Can you play monasteries next to each other (providing roads aren't unfinished between them)? There doesn't appear to be anything in the rules to say that you can't, but it does look a bit odd. Also, if you don't have any meeples left in hand and you draw a monastery card that you have to play, is there any way to score it at all, or do you just lose out on any points?

I'm playing the basic game, with no expansions.

Cheers.

Respuesta 1:
There's nothing to prevent monasteries from being neighbors, feel free to put them next to each other.

If you're out of meeples, you lose the chance at claiming anything new. Work on getting some of them back into your supply.

Respuesta 2:
Hi!

Yes, you can Play them next to each other.

Yes, drawing - and placing - one when you are out of meaples means that you will not be able to Claim it and there will be no Points of that "empty" monastry for you (or anyone else) in that game.

Monasteries can be put next to each other. In the games that I play with my group, there is always a religious area on the map.

The only thing that you have to watch out for is if you play with Cult Mounds. Followers that are put on these are called Heretics. There is a "Religion War" rule that if you put a Monastery near a Cult Mount, whoever completes their scoring area first gets 9 points and the other gets none. My group has house ruled this to 18 points or nothing. If it is a tie, then both get 9. That happens when the final tile completes both the Monastery and Cult Mound in the same move. And yes, you can have a "Religion War" with yourself.

I don't remember the exact wording of the rule, so you might have to look that up.

Tema 228: Scoring a city tile that appears twice in one city

The rules address this issue directly and clearly (my highlight).

A city is complete when it is surrounded by walls and there are no gaps in the walls or the city. There can be any number of sections in a city. A player who owns a knight in a completed city scores 2 points per tile in the city (count the tiles and not the sections).

Respuesta 4:
I know the official rules are to count each tile, but as a house rule we decided to count each city segment.



Tema 229: Meeple Population Control?

It is an implied rule. All you get is is all you get. It makes decisions a little more interesting if you aren't grabbing every road that comes up in order to save it for a better city. It also makes committing to farms early and getting in "dangerous" cities that can't close, that much more risky. Blocking someone's meeple is one of the stratgeties of the game that would be defeated with more/unlimited meeples.

Respuesta 2:
In my version of the game (Big Box 3), under preparation it states:
"Each player places his remaining 7 followers before him on the table as his supply."

Then in the Deploying followers sections one of the bullet points is:
"The player must take it from his supply."

There's nothing wrong with house ruling it the way you've been playing, it's just not the official rules.

Respuesta 3:
The game is much more interesting if you have a limited number of meeples, it makes you decide "is this road/farm/city/monastery worth a meeple"

Otherwise you might as well spam meeples on every opportunity and the only decision is "do I use my meeple as a farmer or something else"

In a typical 3 player game, I'd say max meeple usage per player is between 6 and maybe 10.

Respuesta 7:
I have a Big Box set with a lot of tiles, and I have considered using the robber for scoring to free up a regular meeple. Going from 7 to 8 is only a minor change, especially with so many tiles. As already mentioned, adding on several more actually takes away from the decision making aspect of the game.

Respuesta 8:
You could always use an expansion that adds followers to your supply. Some of these include Inns and Cathedrals, the Phantom, and Abbey and Mayor. If you use all these three expansions simultaneously, you would have eleven followers in your supply.

Because I originally got my game in Spain, it mixed rules weirdly, so 2-tile cities score 2 points, but fields only score 3 points per city (a mix between the 1st and 3rd edition rules, i think) which I think makes it so you're more likely to build bigger cities but there isn't that much difference between field and city.
Another thing is we don't auto-count unused features which you finish, like it says in (at least my) rules. For example, if a player places a tile that finishes a city with no meeples, he has to "spend" a meeple to get it. This is more just what feels right for us, but perhaps someone thinks this impacts negatively?

Your house rule for this follows standard rules. You can claim a feature when you finish it but only if you have a meeple in hand.

Edit: To clarify, because I'm not sure exactly what your rules say, you can claim one feature. The exact process is: 1) place a tile 2) place a meeple on a feature on that tile 3) score completed features (for all players, that have meeples on them, including the one you may have just claimed) 4) reclaim meeples from completed features.
So in practice it's not really necessary to put your meeple on the board since you will reclaim it immediately, but you must have one available in your hand.

I have not followed the whole history of scoring changes. I do know there was an alteration in 2-tile city scoring but I have only known Farmers/fields as scoring 3 points per city.


Quoting current Z-Man rules

•For each city that the field touches, the player with the most farmers in that field scores 3 points. The size of the city does not matter. If some players are tied for the most farmers, they each score the points for that field.

This is exactly what our game has evolved to. It may be more common than you think.

We started out playing with 1st edition rules. When 3rd edition came along we welcomed the change to farm scoring because of the simplification, but we did not favor the change for the 2-tile city to 4 points. So we stuck with the 2-point 2-tile city, and 3 points per city for farms. Because farm scoring increased under 3rd edition it does not make sense to promote small cities to 4 points and increase the tendency for many small cities to be built, which compounds the already over powered farm scoring.



Tema 231: Scoring a completed feature with no meeples
Pregunta:
I need help with a disagreement I am having with my girlfriend.
Is it possible to score the points from a competed feature (road, city...) if you do not have a meeple on it?

I feel that in the rule book that came with the game when they describe how to score a completed feature, that though it is not specifically written, but it is understood that a meeple needs be present to earn those points.

She feels that because it is not specifically written, if she completes a feature, and has no meeples, that she gets the points because she completed that feature.

Can anyone help us on this one?

Respuesta 1:
You're right, you don't get any points if there are no meeples.

Respuesta 2:
You need to have a meeple on it.

However, you can place a meeple on a just completed road or castle (if no other meeples are present) in order to score it. You will get this meeple back immediately. You must have a meeple left in your supply to do this.

Edit: Unlike what your girlfriend thinkgs, if it's not in the rulebook, it's not a rule. Unless it's in an FAQ. Or in an updated edition. Or a correction by the designer in a forum...

Respuesta 3:
Yes, any scoring requires a meeple involved.

The way my wife and I play it is that sometimes when you close off a as-yet-unclaimed thing with a tile and claim it as your placement, we'll announce it but don't actually place anything as you get it right back anyway. Of course, we only do this if we have at least one meeple in reserve at the time. If you have zero meeples, you can't place and retrieve in that way.

Respuesta 4:
Just remind her that it doesn't matter who finishes the feature, but rather who has the most followers in it. If multiple players are tied for the most they all score the points. So if everybody is tied for most at zero followers, then they must all get the points...right?

Respuesta 5:
Scoring is based on who has the most meeples on the feature, not who completed the feature.

If she completes a meeple-less feature and she still has a meeple left to place, she can place it on the feature she just completed, receive the points, and get the meeple back (the shortcut is just to not place the meeple at all, but she still has to have at least one left to place). If ALL her meeples are already in use, then she can't claim any points for completing a meeple-less feature.

In my copy of the rule book it is specifically written that a meeple is required, as that determines who gets the score. No meeple, no player gets the points.

For example, on scoring for a road it says:
Carcassone rule book (p2)
wrote:
A COMPLETED ROAD
A road is complete when the road segments on both ends connect to a crossing, a city segment, or a cloister, or when the road forms a complete loop. There may be many road segments between the ends.
The player who has a thief on a completed road scores one point for each tile in the completed road (count the number of tiles; separate segments on a tile count just once).
The bold text is bold in my rules copy, but I have underlined the bit where it says that it is the player who has a thief on the road who scores the points (remember that Carcasonne never actually calls them "meeples" so it will never say that in the rules, they are "followers" when in the supply and become "thief", "knight" or "monk" when placed); and it has similar phrases for scoring cities and cloisters.

Respuesta 7:
Everyone so far is correct: You can't score a city if you have no meeple on it.

There is one thing you should remember though, what when playing with the Traders & Builders expansion: If you complete a city with trade goods in, it doesn't matter if you have meeple on the city or not (or in fact if your opponent(s) have meeple there) - YOU get the trade goods for completing that city. (You still don't get any points for the completed city if you don't have the majority of meeple on it though).

I suggest that it is specifically written (Edit: as someone before me already has, I now see).


You already know this part

3. If by placing a Land tile one or more roads, cities, and/or monasteries are completed, these features are scored immediately.


But you have overlooked some important instructions that are found in the separate discussions of how each type of feature is scored.


A player who owns a thief on a completed road scores 1 point per tile used in the completed road...

A player who owns a knight in a completed city scores 2 points per tile in the city...

The player who owns a monk in a completed monastery scores 9 points.


She doesn't qualify.

:meeple:
Just to add to what the other said. The play order is this:

1. Pick a tile
2. Put the tile down
3. Put a meeple down on the tile if permitted. In that case you are talking about a feature that has no meeple on it, so you can put one down on it.
4. Score any feature that has been closed. In that case, since you just put down a meeple on a closed feature, it can be scored.

This explain the reasoning.

As someone else said, you can just agree that if you have a meeple left in your supply, you'll score the feature immediately. That's what I do with my partner.

Tema 232: How do you solve ties? two tiles roads are ok?
Pregunta:
Hi
I´ve played my first carcasonne last week (basic game). I have 3 questions:
a) Two players draw in the first position: Is there a rule to solve who wins?
b) Could you have a road with only to tiles?: Two crossroads tiles back to back (2 points), or would you need a third tile in between.

Thanks

We have some homemade tiles that are city "caps" that have a pennant. We also do still play with the 1st edition 2-point rule for small cities mainly because getting 4 points for those as well as 3+ for farms is ridiculous. But any way, we play that the pennant is also muted if it's in a 2-tile city, giving only 1 point. So in our games a 2-tile city with a pennant would be worth 3 points. Sounds like you like to play with the 2-point small city rule too.

Your inclusion of "before multipliers" is perhaps indicating you might think they affect the value of each tile.
No. Multipliers are 0, 1, 2, or 3 for unfinished with Cathedral, unfinished without Cathedral, finished without Cathedral, and finished with Cathedral, respectively. You can choose for yourself whether you count each tile and shield separately, then multiply, or count points for tiles with (2) and without a shield (1) separately, then multiply, the total is the same in both cases.

During the game and without Cathedrals in play, when you finish a city you'll get 2 points for each tile and 2 points for each shield. (Subtract 2 if you play with the 2-tile-city rule.)

Correct - it isn't exactly so. I thought we were just talking about the basic game, in which case, YES, it's 1 point per tile and 1 point per pennant for an incomplete city - and 2 points per tile and 2 points per pennant for a completed city.

Regarding the siege tiles in Carcassonne: Cult, Siege and Creativity , the points are awarded in the same was as in the base game; i.e. 0 point per tile and pennant for an incomplete city, and 1 point per tile and per pennant for each completed city.


It is correct, however, that the rules change slightly with the small expansion Carcassonne: Mage & Witch :
In case the Mage is in your completed city, it scores an additional point for each tile that is in the completed city - but each pennant still only scores 2 points (if playing with the base game rules). So, if a mage is located in a completed city consisting of 5 tiles, one of them having a pennant, you would score 5 x 3 points + 2 points (for the pennant). The witch halves the points per tile in the completed city.

Hope this clarifies it!

Tema 234: bridge on a pest tile
Pregunta:
On one of the tiles there's a road crossing another road over a bridge. Are the fields on both sides of the bridge connected under the bridge, or are they two separate fields?
Anyway, what's the point of the bridge? Either alternative could be done unambigously without it.

Respuesta 1:
The fields are not connected under the bridge. If it's the tile I'm thinking of, it has 3 separate field segments (because one of the roads doesn't go all the way across the tile). There's a similar tile in Traders & Builders which has 4 field segments (because both roads do go all the way across).

The reason for the bridge is that it creates 2 separate roads, but one of them doesn't end on this tile. If it was a T junction, it would be 3 roads which would all end on this tile. Also, if you're using Abbey and Mayor, the roads aren't connected for the purpose of the wagon.

Yes. If the farmers are equal, they both score. Red will score more points, however, because their pig is present.
I might be wrong but I thought you only got the pig bonus if you had a majority in that field? (You'd still share the standard points in this situation though)
Correct. But if you tie, you have majority as well. So both red and blue tie for majority. Both red and blue will score. Red will score more because the pig increases the fields for him while blue scores the normal points.



Tema 238: Question about scoring 2 or more features at once
Pregunta:
Hello friends,

First time poster

I just purchased the Carcassonne base game and I have a question about a rule that I dont understand.

Lets say I place a tile that has a road and castle wall on it, and I have a knight in the castle, and by placing this tile I close the castle, can I place a meeple on the road and receive the points for the closing of the castle? Or do I only get the points for closing the castle?

Respuesta 1:
Once a castle is closed the player with the majority of knights scores the castle. If the castle you are closing with the placement of the tile is already controlled by you (majority) then placing your meeple on the road still allows you to score the castle.

Just make sure that IF the tile you place also extends an existing road that the road is vacant, otherwise placing a meeple on the road is prohibited.

Keep playing...

Respuesta 2:
The answer to your question is yes.

You place the tile, then you place a meeple (at a legal spot, and only if you want to), and then you score any finished structures.

It is actually quite common to place a meeple and immediately score it, so the order of these steps is important.

Respuesta 3:
And lets say (extreme) if by placing the tile I close the castle (in which I have the meeple placed), but the tile connects to an empty road that will too get closed, can I place the meeple and get the points from both? (very extreme : it will also close a church-monastery (being the last tile from the 9 tiles) do i get points for all 3?

Respuesta 4:
providing you have meeples and/or majority in all three, then yes you score them all.

Hope you're enjoying the game

Respuesta 5:
Yes for all, just follow rules, draw tile, put on table, put meeple on legal spot and than score all meeples you have.

You will get points for all 3 only if you already have majority in 2 of them before placing the tile. Remember that you can place only ONE meeple per turn.

Respuesta 7:
What do you mean majority? If we all have on the same castle or road? dont well all get the points?

Respuesta 8:
If you have majority, only YOU will get the points. If there are one or more players with the same number of meeples, everybody gets the points. I hope I didn't confuse you too much.

Yes, if you have and others all the same number of meeples on a road, you will all get full points for the road. But if one of you has more meeples than everyone else, than only that person gets points.

It doesnt confuses me, but I haven't read anything about this in the small rule book that came with the game, weird they leave out so many rules. This happened with Catan as well.

Respuesta 11:
Licious, since you're considering situations with multiple players having meeples on the same road, farm, and castle, keep in mind that the only way this can legally occur is if the land, roads, or buildings merge. In other words, if you place a road tile, for example, and someone already has a meeple on it you cannot place a meeple on the road. Only empty roads, farms, and bulidings can be claimed, should they merge later then the majority rule comes into play.

Others are already giving you the correct guidance but here it is directly from the current ZMan rules (page 1)

Playing the game
Players take their turn one after the other, starting with the first player and then proceeding clockwise: on their turn, a player must do the following actions and follow the order listed below:
1. Draw and place one new Land tile.
2. Then, the player can take one (1) of his followers from his supply and put it on the tile he has just placed.
3. If by placing a Land tile one or more roads, cities, and/or monasteries are completed, these features are scored immediately.

I've highlighted part of #3 because it relates directly to your question. I've quoted all three steps to emphasize what others have already said about the order/sequence being important.

Tema 239: Supplementary Rules from New Edition Including The Abbot, The River, and The Farmers
Pregunta:
The official pdf has now been updated to include the supplemental rules.

Here's the full text in english:

￼CARCASSONNE — SUPPLEMENTARY RULES

Welcome again! If you are reading this, it means that you’ve already played a few games of Carcassonne and that you wish to increase the strategic options at your disposal.
What would life be without agriculture? We try to answer part of this question by introducing the hard-working farmers who spend long hours in the fields of Carcassonne. As we did for the roads, cities, and monasteries, the farmers will be presented using the actions of a game turn.

THE FARMERS

1. Placing a tile
As you are now used to, you must place your tile in such a way that it continues the landscape and illustration. Fields always refer to the green spaces found in the landscape of Carcassonne. On the tile shown to the right, there are three field segments.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼2. Placing a meeple as a farmer
A farmer is a meeple that you place “laying down” in a field segment.
“Laying down?” Yes. Unlike highwaymen, knights, and monks that are all placed standing up, farmers are laid down on a tile because they are only scored at the end of the game. Consequently, they are not returned to your supply after scoring. Laying farmers down ensures that you remember to leave them on the board.
As always, you can only place your farmer if there are no other farmers in the field.
The fields of Carcassonne are divided by roads and cities. Pictured right are three separate fields.

￼3. Scoring fields
As mentioned previously, farmers are not scored during the game and, consequently, they do not return to your supply. So place your farmers wisely. Now, let’s assume the game is over and that we are conducting the final scoring. A Unlike other features, it is not the field tiles that are counted, but the number of completed cities that border a field. Each completed city that touches a field adds 3 points to the value of that field. All fields touched by a city will see their value increased by 3 points.

You now know how to play with farmers! Here is a summary of the most important rules concerning farmers:

- Farmers are placed “laying down” on the board.
- Farmers are only scored during the final scoring.
- Each completed city adjacent to a field you occupy gives you 3 points.
- As is the case with roads and cities, there may be more than one farmer
in the same field.
- Once again, the same scoring rules apply to farmers. Only the player
with the most farmers in a fields scores the points for that field. In
case of a tie, the tied players each score full points.



THE RIVER
The River is the first mini expansion you will discover in the Carcassonne universe. It embellishes the landscape while also varying the starting situation.

Components
The River is comprised of 12 River tiles with a dark back that replace the start tile. When playing with The River, return the start tile to the box.

Setup
Set aside the “source” ￼ and “lake” ￼ tiles. The remaining River tiles are shuffled and stacked facedown. Finally, slide the lake tile under that stack and set the source tile as the starting point.

Gameplay
Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise one after the other, players place tiles as usual (including the possibility of placing a meeple), with the exception that they must draw tiles from the River tile stack. You must continue drawing from the River stack until it runs out of tiles.

As usual, you must continue the illustration. Furthermore, you must continue the river illustration, and the river cannot turn twice in the same direction because this would create a u-turn.
You may place meeples along the river following the normal rules.



THE ABBOT
The Abbot is the second mini expansion presented in this box.
It introduces gardens, which you may have already noticed on the tiles, and abbots.

Components and setup
This mini expansion includes 5 abbots in the player colors. Each player receives the abbot in their color.

Gameplay
1. Placing a tile
When you place a tile with a monastery or a garden, follow the normal rules.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼2. Placing a meeple OR your abbot
When placing a tile with a monastery or a garden, you may place either a meeple or your abbot.
The meeple is placed as usual whereas the abbot must be placed on the monastery or garden you’ve
just placed.
3. Scoring an abbot
If the monastery or garden occupied by your abbot is surrounded by eight tiles, you score 9
points just like during a regular monastery scoring. As you can see, gardens are scored exactly
like monastery, with the exception that only an abbot may be placed on them.
The abbot also has another special ability. On your turn during action 2 (Placing a meeple), if you decide not to place a meeple, you are allowed to take back your abbot.
If you do so, you score as many points as the abbot is worth at that time, exactly like an end game monastery final scoring. During final scoring, abbots are scoring in the same manner.


You are now truly ready to embark on the grand voyages that the Carcassonne universe has in stores for you! More expansions can be found here: www.zmangames.com. See you soon!

It's worth noting that the text I've excerpted above is off to the side as a caption on a picture giving an example. The 6 points specified fits that example, but of course isn't always the case. I was temporarily baffled when I reached that point -- hope this saves someone else confusion!

Tema 240: rescuing trapped meeples
Pregunta:
I was recently reading about various expansions.. and I remember there was one that - either by a special tile, or by a special meeple, allowed you to retrieve a trapped follower.
But I have forgotten which.. and how this was done..
Any of you experts can tell me please?

It's the 10th Anniversary Festival. As your wood move you can reclaim any figure from the board.

Respuesta 4:
Both Corn Circles and 10th Anniversary can allow you to take back meeples.

Corn Circle tiles are each made to work for a specific feature, and everyone gets to do the same action chosen (either remove from said feature, or add another). The 10th Anniversary tiles lets you take back any meeple, and only works for the player playing it.

Shipping from Cundco in Germany isn't that expensive and is worthwhile if they have a another expansion or two that you want. I picked up   and   for around $16. Sure it's a fair amount per tile, but it was worth it. Blank tiles, wind roses, gummy meeples, festival and more await you!



Tema 241: Cab soneone explain how to score farms?
Pregunta:
Played 2 games and I can't work out how to score farms.

We had a game today where I think I scored 98 points from my farns at the end. Is this possible?

Am I right in thinking that if I can trace a line of unbroken green spaces (not blocked by roads) from my meeple to a complete city, then it gets 3 points? The setup at the end seemed to allow me to connect my neeples to basically every city on the map.

The diagrams in the rules are only in areas of 6 tikes, but my emdsetup has all the tiles laid out.

Eco

Respuesta 1:
Yes, that's right, but don't forget that it's not EVERY meeple in the area, it's the ONE meeple of the player with the MOST meeples. 98pts sounds very unlikely, but possible it there are LOADS of teeny tiny 2 tile cities.

98 isn't a multiple of 3 though... so you've clearly got some maths wrong!

Respuesta 2:
there are actually several different versions of farmer scoring.

The one I use separates each individual field space and scores them separately.
In this way, farmers can only ever score once, and cities can score in multiple fields.

Another versions scores each city separately, counting every possible farmer meeple that could contribute to that city, but this one is a bit more complicated, since you can't pick up your meeples after scoring (and I believe it's a bit reason why they changed it).


As for your question, yes, you can sometimes end with very large fields, and one farmer meeple can potentially score on a city that is many tiles away.


As for your score of 98, did you have the Pig, Pig Field, Barn, Castle or some other method of scoring a value other than 3 or 4? If so, 98 is not possible since they all should be in multiples of 3 or 4 (depending on your version)

Respuesta 3:
It sounds correct. But do be aware that a farmer can never get more than three points once per city adjacent to his field. If you can draw more lines to the same city, it is still three points.

One player can score more than once per town, with multiple farmers. Each Farmer can only score once for each complete town touching his field (assuming he is the only farmer). If one player has a farmer in separate fields touching the same city he will score 3pts for each farmer.

Unless you are playing the "Traders and Builders" expansion. Then the pig makes such farmer scores possible (not that I've ever known anybody to score that many farmer points).

Respuesta 7:
Here's the method we use to score farmers:

+ Score all the other features and remove those meeples

+ Once there are only farmers on the board we remove any beaten farmers. For example if a field contains two red, one black and one blue farmer then we remove the black and blue farmers.

+ Once the ownership of each field is clear we pick a field and count every completed city touching that field. The winning player or players then get three points per city.

+ Remove the meeples of the farm which was just scored and go on to the next one.

Everyone pays attention during this phase since it is easy to make mistakes.

I don't know that I've ever seen a farmer score in the 90s but when we started playing we were very naive about farming. People built a lot of two tile cities (which actually gain the farmer more points than themselves) and made no real effort to cut the farms in to smaller pieces. I definitely remember games where there was one giant farm which touched every city.

Yes, it can be, but it'd also be remiss of other playing to not try and fight you for it if it gets big. Previous scoring rules would say that a 2 tile city was only 2 points, but that increased to the standard 2 points per tile at some point.

the Inns & cathedrals and Traders & builders expansions are generally seen to be standard editions to the base box (with most other expansions being pointless nonsense), and with these in the mix, you have plenty of other more meaningful reasons to want to build larger cities and such. That's not to say that focusing on farms is significant strategy compared to others.



Tema 242: Expansion Combinations - Ambiguous Rules
Pregunta:
Hi,

Although I have read the rules carefully, I am uncertain about a couple of scenarios. Perhaps some of these are covered in more recent rule books, but I was unable to find anything useful online. Perhaps you guys could shed some light on these issues.

1. [Traders & Builders + the Princess & the Dragon]

The rules say that a princess tile will also remove a player's builder if their last knight in a city is returned to them. However, it says no such thing about the dragon removing such a knight; it only talks about the dragon coming across builders. Does the builder thus become stuck until the city's completion? What about the dragon coming across a player's last farmer on a field; will the pig be returned to them or does it become stuck, making it more important for its owner to fight for that field, if possible? A literal interpretation of the rules would suggest the latter.

2. [Traders & Builders + the Crop Circles]

A similar situation occurs with crop tiles. Will pigs and builders be returned to their owners if their last knight in a city or farmer on a field, respectively, are removed?

3. [The Princess & the Dragon]

Granted, this isn't a question regarding an expansion combination, but I'll ask it anyway since it's a prerequisite to the following question. According to the rules, a player may move the fairy around whenever he doesn't place a follower, a big, a builder, or some other goodies from expansions I don't yet own. How about on turns on which they pick up volcano tiles or princess tiles (assuming they remove a knight instead of placing one?), since they're not allowed to place a follower et al. in the first place?

4. [The Princess and the Dragon + the Crop Circles]

Again, what happens if a type of follower is removed due to a crop tile? Does the player get to move the fairy?

5. [The Phantom + the Crop Circles]

Can a phantom be placed/returned if a crop circle demands it?

Thanks,
Bogdan

Thank you very much. How official are these rules, by the way? Was this compilation prepared by the author, was he contacted, or is it a general agreement in the community?

EDIT: Nevermind, the document specifies where the information comes from.

Respuesta 3:
Just to clarify for those not getting the CAR right now, the rules conflicts are primarily decided by Hans im Glück, the game's publisher, with further clarifications provided from different editions of rules documents, common variants, misconceptions, Rio Grande Games (the former English-publisher), and Spielbox (though inconsistently). Most issues are resolved in the text through official channels. And rest assured, those that are not resolved are pending resolution. We're pretty militant about it.

Respuesta 4:
I'm also quite the pedant. I've been reading the CAR (along with the manuals from HiG, RGG, ZMG, Spiel Box, and a couple of other documents) and have been putting together a list of (mainly small) corrections/updates and questions not (yet) addressed therein. I plan on letting the author know about it. I saw your name mentioned a few times, btw.

Since I'm only interested in the latest official rules, I'm also putting together a document of my own, which is way shorter (it doesn't cover the differences between different generations, it doesn't mention house rules, it doesn't bother with Carcassonne World Championship, etc.), and much better structured (it basically follows the flow of the game, mentioning how each expansion affects the gameplay at every step). I will probably publish it, in case anyone is interested.



Tema 243: Rules question
Pregunta:
Just a quick question. I completed a city. I had 2 meeples in it and he had 1 so that means i get the points. Question is does he also get his meeple back or only me??

Also does it matter if he completed the same city instead of me would he than get the meeple back?

Thanks in advance

Respuesta 1:
You both get your meeples back.

Respuesta 2:
Thank you very much for a fast response.

Respuesta 3:
Whenever any fixture is completed, everyone invested in that fixture gets their meeples back, regardless who completed it or who got points for it.

In your example, a third person (without any meeples out) could have completed the city, you would get the points, and you and the other person with knights in the city gets their meeples back.

Some of the expansions slighhtly mess with these rules a bit, but for most intents and purposes, No meeple can be 'trapped' in a fixture that's already scored, and anything still on the board should be able to potentially score points in the future

Respuesta 4:
Antonio
@yox1
Question is does he also get his meeple back or only me??
My own question would be, what is there in the rules that could make you think this might be so?

Here are two quotes (with my highlighting on one plural word)

What if there are more than one follower on a completed road or city?
With some clever tile placements, it is possible to connect road and city sections,
resulting in a road with more than one thief or a city with more than one knight.
The player with the most thieves or knights scores the totality of the
points. In case of a tie, the tied players each score the points.

After scoring a road, a city or a monastery – and only then – the followers used in the scoring are returned to their
player's supply. These returned followers may become thieves, knights, monks and farmers during the following turns.


No special case is mentioned. So often it is true that what isn't in the rules is just as important as what is.

I do follow your reasoning, but I would say they were "used" when they got counted to determine player dominance (and then simply not awarded any points).

I would certainly expect a further rules explanation of the special case if things were otherwise.

It's not always a terrible thing (although it does give them back a meeple). If you cut short a feature your opponent was hoping to expand, it could be to your advantage - moreso perhaps in a more-than-2p game where it's not zero-sum.

Tema 245: Mayor, Wagon, Phantom vs. Corn Circles & Abbey
Pregunta:
Are the Mayor, Wagon, & Phantom meeples considered to be the type of follower that a Corn Circle causes to be abducted or added?

i.e., I have a Mayor in a city & a Shield Corn Circle tile is placed. Is the Mayor considered to be a "knight" and thus can be removed from the board or have a meeple added to the tile the Mayor occupies?

i.e., the Wagon (or Phantom) is on a road and a Thief Corn Circle tile is placed. Is the Wagon (or Phantom) considered to be a Thief?


A slightly different question here: does an Abbey trigger the Builder meeple's 2nd tile draw if an Abbey completes a city side?

i.e.:

xCx
FAF
xRx

x is clear
C is City w/ a Builder meeple
F is Field
R is Road
A is Abbey

Does placing Abbey trigger the Builder occupying the City?

Thanks in advance!

Yes, those three are Followers having different abilities and limitations than a normal Follower. Think of their use like this: When a Follower is placed into a feature it takes a certain occupation in the feature without losing its identity. A Mayor in a City holds the occupation of the Knight. The same for a Wagon or a Phantom in a City. A Wagon or Phantom on a Road takes the occupation of a Theif, likewise if they are in a Cloister they hold the occupation of the Monk. So these Followers are subject to any mechanic that affects their particular occupation.

A slightly different question here: does an Abbey trigger the Builder meeple's 2nd tile draw if an Abbey completes a city side?
You only get the extended Builder turn if you extend a feature that your Builder is in. An Abbey does not extend a feature, likewise it is not counted in the scoring for that particular feature. It truncates a feature without adding to it, so it does not generate an extended Builder turn.

Respuesta 2:
Carcking is correct. Just to add to what he said though. If the Abbey completes the city, the city is scored and the builder(s) and knight(s) are returned to their owners.



Tema 246: Scoring two times in one turn
Pregunta:
p3rka
wrote:
When you place a tile and score a structure (a structure that already had your meeple on it from previous turns) are you still allowed to place a meeple for that turn and score one more time?
In what fashion you score meeples and take them back to your hand? Could you take first meeple and use it to score second time (if that's your last one)?
You can score as many elements as you complete, including any completed by the meeple placed this turn.

But the sequencing must always be:

1. Place a tile.
2. Place a meeple, if you wish.
3. Score all completed structures and get the meeples back.

So you cannot take a meeple back because it scored and then use it again the same turn.

Respuesta 1:
It has to be in this order:

1. Place your tile.
2. You may put down a meeple on your tile.
3. Score any completed structures and get your meeples back.

So YOU CAN'T use a meeple from a completed structure to put on your tile. But YOU CAN put a meeple on your tile, and if it completes a structure, get is back straight away.

Respuesta 2:
Hence the strategy of trying to always have a spare meeple for quick point scoring. When you other partners fight for the farms, it might actually come in handy.

Respuesta 3:
Correct answer already given, but here's a quote from the rules for reinforcement.

Players take their turn one after the other, starting with the first player and then proceeding clockwise: on their turn, a player must do the following actions and follow the order listed below:

1. Draw and place one new Land tile.
2. Then, the player can take one (1) of his followers from his supply and put it on the tile he has just placed.
3. If by placing a Land tile one or more roads, cities, and/or monasteries are completed, these features are
scored immediately.

The player's turn is now over and the next player takes her turn by following the same rules.

Tema 247: Can't place tile for own benefit. Do I need to place on some else's city/road?
Pregunta:
I know the rules say that if you can't physically place a new tile, then you have to discard the tile and draw a new one. However, does that mean you need to try placing a tile on your opponent's city or road before the option of discarding is available? In other words, are your opponents owned cities/roads mandatory to place into if your tile can only fit there?

Or maybe there is a rule where you strictly can't place on your opponents owned land... I thought that only applies if you're trying to claim it is your own instead of just expanding.

I hope my question makes sense!

Respuesta 1:
Yes - sometimes you have to add to other people's roads or cities, but you may get the opportunity to share or steal them later.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, you have to place the tile if it's possible. Even if it will help your opponents but I think this is not very often the case.

Respuesta 3:
The title question is a little misleading (especially with people answering "yes"). From the thread title is sounds like it is asking "If I can't place the tile to expand my own feature, must I place it to expand an opponent's feature?" - to which the answer is "No, you can just as validly place it expanding a feature controlled by nobody at all".


You must place the tile somewhere if you can. Whether this placement expands your features, your opponents' features, or features controlled by nobody at all (or multiple of the above at once!) is not relevant. There is no obligation or order of precedence among those three whatsoever. If there exists at least one legal placement for it, you must place it in one of the possible legal placements. Only if no legal placement exists do you discard it.

I love the bolded point. If an opponent is trying to close a large city, I like to throw in another city tile that might make it tough or even impossible for him to complete the city. One extra point for a tile is much better than the double points they would get for a completed city.

In short: you HAVE to place the tile you've just drawn in a legal position. Even if it's not in your interests. Only if there is no legal position* you may discard the tile and draw another one.

From the RULES:

•New tiles must always continue fields, cities and/or roads.

In the unlikely situation where a drawn tile cannot be placed (all
players must agree), the player returns the tile to the box (it will
no longer be used for this game) and draws another tile.

a) "cannot be placed" is not the same as "cannot be placed for your own benefit".

b) whatever would make you think all the other player's would agree to let you off ?

Respuesta 11:
I have yet to find a situation where I can't place a tile. Even with the River (following the no U-turn placement rule).

Not saying it doesn't exist, just that I haven't seen it happening.

As the other said, you shall place a tile if there is a valid place for it. Even if it give points to an opponent.

Respuesta 12:
I think we have had this happen 3 times total, and we have played 50+ games. I'm almost certain that all cases have been with a four-sided city / cathedral tile, and all city placements have been somehow blocked (like requiring 3-sided city or road-city pieces), perhaps once there were no open cities at all.

If you don't play with takeover and blocking style, then I would not be surprised if you never see the situation of a tile not fitting anywhere. (Hah, did I use enough negatives there?)



Tema 248: Different scoring rules for 2 tiles cities ?
Pregunta:
I owned this game for quite a while now and played a lot of games on my iPad.
Scoring for cities built from only two tiles always scored 4 points.

However, I played with someone yesterday and he swore he read in another's persons rulebook that 2 tiles cities scored only two points (mine says 2 point per tiles, no exceptions).

Was the scoring rules for 2 tiles cities been revised since the second edition?

Edit: typos, clarifications

Respuesta 1:
Some older version of the game treat 2 tile cities differently for scoring. I've the Han im Glueck version which doesn't. I believe that's the same for most newer editions.

Yes. Jay at RGG stuck with the same scoring (farms and 2-tile cities) long after the rest of the world moved on; IIRC, he only updated to the current regime with the advent of the Big Boxes.

Respuesta 3:
Correct, 2-tile cities scored 2 points in first edition German copies of Carcassonne, as well as all English copies printed by Rio Grande. However, all modern printings of the game, as well as video game adaptations, score the standard 4 points for a 2-tile city.

I don't think that's correct. I have an English Rio Grande version from 2000 (including River expansion), and there is no different scoring for two tile cities in there, they still score 4.

Respuesta 5:
The older rules are/were: 2-tile cities score 2, field scoring 4 points per finished city, but there was also something a little bit different with the field scoring in those rules.

Respuesta 6:
I don't recall when the 2-tile city scores 2 points was introduced. I am thinking it was 2nd edition rules. RGG was stuck on 1st edition (farms scored differently), then 2nd edition changed the cities, I thought. 3rd edition changed them back to normal scoring and has the present farm scoring rules.

I assume the 2-tile scoring was designed to leave cities open so that there was more scoring potential and less chance of dead tiles. But given the exception to the rules and so many more tiles in the game through expansions, it just isn't effective so best to discard it.

Just for added perspective,   uses some alternate rules on a similar issue. A significant difference for this version is allowing players to withdraw pawns from incomplete features for a lower scoring.

Hello wise ones.
I just played Carcassonne with the fam, and added Inns and Cathedrals.

Tema 252: Pigsty in River 2
Pregunta:
Can you use this piece if you don't play with traders expansion? Do you think this one piece would unbalance the game, giving to big of an advantage to the person who gets it?

Respuesta 1:
We left it out (but we've only played River II once).

You could play it (for a tile) and skip the effect though.

Respuesta 2:
Sure, you can use it with the rules from Traders & Builders if you like. The player who gets it will gain an advantage, but not a huge one. Assuming they claim the field, other players may still share it or take it from them. And it's only a bonus of 1 point per completed city on that field anyway, so I can't imagine it'd be game-breaking.

Personally, though, I just consider it artwork, and don't treat it like the pigs from Traders & Builders, regardless of whether we're using that expansion or not.

Respuesta 3:
We use it for the extra point and it works fine.

Respuesta 4:
As it's on the river, it comes out early, so other players have time to react to it - either by trying to cut off the farm or by trying to share in the points.

One of the fun aspects of Carcassonne IMO is that many of the expansion mechanics are plug and play. Most of the major official expansions are a conglomeration of mini mechanics which can be implemented individually, or left off the game entirely without really affecting the balance of the game.

So to answer your question you can plug and play, pick and choose, however your group likes.

Yes, that's all correct in terms of rules, but a monastry is only worth 9 points. a city of 9 tiles is worth at least double that, with pennants doubling those tiles. So you must surely be going wonky somewhere there, and monastry tiles are absolute not a winning formula in themselves at all.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, you can place all monasteries next to each other.

Respuesta 3:
Monasteries can be good, but it's rare for a person to be able to place them like that. Plus each one ties up one of your meeples, which might better be put to use elsewhere. I don't usually find them that powerful.

Respuesta 4:
Yeah most of our two player games (we've played many over 3 years) are decided by farms, not monasteries. What you propose (all of the monasteries placed next to each other) is technically possible, but HIGHLY unlikely, and many more points can be scored on other features than monasteries.

Even if the player gets six monasteries (I think there are 8 in the base set) placed next to each other, that's going to take six of their seven meeples and fourteen tiles (that match appropriately) to complete those features. While their meeples are tied up you can wreak havoc building cities (big or small; I go for many small, 3-4 tile cities), diverting roads and placing farmers (to take advantage of those cities). There's no reason that every game should be decided by monasteries, you are probably just missing something.

Respuesta 5:
Furthermore, each two tile city is worth four points. Put it in a farm that you own, and its worth seven (four for the city itself, three in the farm at the end game). This takes two meeples, but one of them you get back right away and the other can help score far more points. Much more efficient.

Respuesta 6:
Early in my Carc career I also had the sense that the winner was the one who drew more monasteries (cloisters). But it wasn't long before I started thinking differently.

It's true that monasteries are more effective if you can get points out of the surrounding tiles as you place them, and it's not uncommon to see multiple adjacent monasteries because of this. It's also true that you're adding typically four or five points to your score the instant you place a meeple on a monastery, and those points are guaranteed (unlike other features, where if you don't score them immediately, the points you think are yours can end up being stolen). But by default, each subsequent tile you add around a monastery gives you one additional point, which is not a winning pace. City tiles (for comparison), with a fair shot at being two points each as you will finish a city more than 50% of the time, add points faster. Especially when you factor in the pennants.

Monasteries also have a downside with respect to meeple-management. You have to finish the nine tiles to get your meeple back. That can be a long time to have a piece out of the rotation; play a couple of monasteries and you may find that before long you won't be able to take advantage of quick scoring opportunities. Meanwhile, your opponent(s) can play tiles that make it harder for you to complete the nine you need to get the meeple back.

I will almost never go beyond two meeples in monasteries simultaneously, and sometimes I'll even decline to place a meeple in the second, depending on my supply and the stage of the game.

My advice: pay attention to the farms. A player who dominates the farm points at the endgame is very likely to win.

Respuesta 7:
I've gotten 3 "overlapping" cloisters before. it's fun, to have 4 tiles that are shared by 3 of them, and another 4 doubling up. Fun feel of "efficiency". However, this is rare. It's not as good to have 3 all over the place as now, you're spending too many actions trying to complete all of them. If it's late game, then that's different, as you're just mad grabbing for points without regards to getting meeples back.

Otherwise, there are plenty of other solid avenues to points, as already mentioned by others.

Respuesta 9:
I played games with 4-6 players last night and I believe in games with that many players if someone draws a few (or most) of the monastery tiles it greatly increases their chance of winning. In our 4-player game one of the players drew all but one of the monastery tiles and won by a large margin because they got about 30 points at the end of the game, which ended up being a very low-scoring game. Granted, the fields were pretty small that game but that is still pretty good. In our 5- and 6-player games they were evenly spread out so it didn't make any difference then.

From The Complete Annotated Rules v. 6.4:

If more than one feature is scored on a single turn, the entire point value for each individual feature must be scored by moving a single counting follower. The active player can receive only one Message from a round of scoring (even if, for example, both counting followers are on dark number fields through the scoring of several finished
features). However, if the active player gets points from a Message, it is possible that he or she could move a counting follower and receive another Message, playing it in the same turn. Chains of scoring in this way can continue indefinitely.

The dragon eats all followers on a tile, even if one is in a tower

Hiram Witkop
@hyramdubya
In the Tower Exp. can you capture builder, pigs, barns, meeples in castles?
Under the current rules, the pig & the builder are no longer considered to be followers, and thus they cannot be taken prisoner. Contrary, the mayor and the wagon can be eaten by the dragon, captured by the tower, and seduced by a princess. A barn is not a follower, so it cannot be removed by the dragon, nor taken prisoner by a tower.You can imprison the knights staying in the cities.

Hope that helps!

Respuesta 2:
It should also be noted, that the dragon does not eat the tower, but only the follower on it.

Also, if the last of a players farmers is removed from a field with the pig, the pig is also removed. This also applies to builders on roads and in cities.

Respuesta 3:
You're a bloodthirsty lot - the dragon doesn't eat or kill your meeples, it just scares them away! That's how you get them returned to your meeple pool to claim other features.

Tema 255: Question on The Flying Machine (from Big Box 4)
Pregunta:
Hi all. I played my 1st Carcassonne: The Flier mini-expansion tonight, and found an interesting scenario.

I and my opponent have already occupied (and thus share) a city, leaving just 1 tile to complete the feature. The next tile I pick up consists a fly machine. I was wondering if I can place near the city, so that I can put my another meeple flying to the city, having 2 followers of mine on that city, and thus driving my opponents out when scoring.

Is that permitted from the rule?

Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
Hi Steven,

Yes, you can do that, but:

- The new tile with the Flying Machine can not finish the city

- You have to place it correctly, so the arrow will point towards the city

- You have to be lucky with your die roll

Remember that due to the flight, two followers can stand on the same city segment.

Respuesta 2:
Why can't it finish the city? Does the flyer not fly before scoring takes place?

Respuesta 3:
According to The Complete Annotated Rules v 6.4 you cannot:

A player cannot place a flier on a structure that was finished by the tile that was just placed, as a feature is considered completed at the moment that a tile is placed, and the flier can only land on an unfinished feature.

Yes, this is true. When a player plays a Wing tile he must decide where to play wood. One of his options is to place wood on the Wing itself. By doing so he forfeits the ability to place wood into an unoccupied feature he completes with that tile.

We know he may have chosen that feature directly under the normal rules of wood placement. Perhaps though there is a larger city nearby that he would like to take a shot at landing into and figured if he fell short he could still land in the feature he just completed, as a fail safe. Landing in the just completed feature wouldn't be allowed because he already forfeited that feature by choosing the Wing feature.

On a player's turn he executes the following actions in the order shown.

* If, by placing the land tile, cloisters, roads, and/or cities are completed, they are now scored.

2 fields. The "cornfield" interrupts the green, separating it into 2.

Quote:

No, there is no field on the second tile, since there's no green on it. There are 2 separate city segments, of course, so each could be part of a different city.

Respuesta 2:
I agree. The corn circle is a separate feature. It divides fields because it is different than a field, which answers the 2nd question. There is no field on the tile in the second image.

Not in the section for this expansion, no. It might be an idea to add it! (If CAR-editor-type people are reading this.)

But the principle is shown on p89, where it's clear that the (similar-looking) fairs from the Catapult expansion do split the fields:

Quote:
Question: Do the yellow areas split the (green) field in two (tile with cloister and tile with two
opposing city segments)? Answer: If the (green) field is disconnected, the fair does split it.
I don't see the "fields are green" principle anywhere on the CAR (except implied in the above quote), though I'm sure I read it somewhere.



However, some expansions have cities with bridges connecting different parts of the city, and it's been stated that those don't split the farms.

Tema 258: Incomplete cities and monasteries question
Pregunta:
Hi BGG

I recently played Carcassonne for the first time and I was a bit confused on the scoring of incomplete cities and monasteries.

1. If a tile is only connected to the monastery on the corner, does it still count as a point?

2. If a city tile is only connected to the corner of another city tile, will only the one tile count as part of the incomplete city?

Let me know if I need to be more detailed.

Respuesta 1:
1. YES - any of the 8 possible surrounding tiles count as points (with the cloister itself being worth a point)

2. YES - the tile needs to be orthogonal adjacent to count in a city, other wise it is a separate city.

Respuesta 2:
Little Neddie Knickers
@plays for keeps
1. YES - any of the 8 possible surrounding tiles count as points (with the cloister itself being worth a point)

2. YES - the tile needs to be orthogonal adjacent to count in a city, other wise it is a separate city.
Yes, these are both correct.

To expand a little: the reason cities don't count as connected if they only touch at the corner is that there are tiles which will separate that into two different cities, so until a connecting piece is played you can't know whether it will be one city or two. So it counts as two until it's definitely and irreversibly connected up.

Respuesta 3:
Thanks for clarifying both of you! I did consider the tile that can split it into 2 cities so I'm glad I got that right.

Respuesta 4:
Not your question, but a related issue: if a tile has two distinct city segments on it and they are both ultimately connected to the same city, you only count that tile once during scoring. Cities are scored by the number of tiles they occupy, not their number of segments.

A very useful pointer. This applies to roads too, only score each tile once.

@CarlosXiangqi

True. The rules for uncompleted feature scoring could have been summed up by saying "score exactly like completed features, except give 1 point per tile for cities".


Quote:
Another question, if two cloisters with monks of the same player are next to each other, their surrounding tiles count separate?
All features are scored separately. The two cloisters are independent of each other and each are scored according to how many tiles are in the 3x3 area centred on the cloister.



Tema 259: Inns & Cathedrals expansion - strange rule ?
Pregunta:
Hi,

I've just purchased the Inns & Cathedrals expansion, and I notice the rules state that one of the new road junction tiles may not have a thief placed on it (its the one with two opposing city walls and a road junction in the middle).

I was just wondering what this rule adds to the game? Playing without the rule doesn't seem to detract from the game and playing with it doesn't seem to add anything. I'm guessing that the designers had a good reason to single out one tile like that, so I think I'm missing something. Any ideas?

Thanks,

K

Respuesta 1:
They were just clarifying the art which looked to present a scoring opportunity. They are talking about the tine roads that are self contained on the tile, not the one that exits at each end. The point is no single tile should give you points. All scoring should consist of at least 2 tiles (with the exception of the unfinished components at the end of the game).

Respuesta 2:
It doesn't add or subtract anything from the game. I think they just wanted to make it so you can't just get a "free" point. That's basically what it is. House rule it if you want I don't think it make one difference unless you loss by one point.

Respuesta 3:
I initially thought they were referring to the very small roads that would have provided an instant score, but the rules clearly point to the large roads that exit from each end of the tile...

My point was that the art had already been fixed long before this error, which is obviously recent (postdating the Z-Man Big Box).

If it's true that Z-Man also supply the images for the rules, other language versions published recently should also have the wrong image! Or maybe this was the first edition with this error, and others will have it in future unless it's caught and corrected.

Tema 260: Scoring farms
Pregunta:
In the original rules for Carcassonne, it states farmers score three points per city they touch. However, in Traders and Builders, it says farmers with pigs score five instead of four points per city? Am I reading it wrong, is this a misprint, or did they change the rules? Is normal scoring three or four? Do pigs make it four or five? Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
Normal is 3, I haven't played T&B in a while, so idk about pigs .

Respuesta 2:
If I recall correctly, the rules from T & B follow an older edition of Carcassonne. 3 points per city is the right number (4 with the pig) - ignore 4 points from T&B.

Respuesta 3:
There have been at least three major versions of the rules. In at least one of those versions farms scored four points per city. Your Traders & Builders expansion may have been printed while that version was in effect.

The current rules are three per city. The Pig adds plus one point per city scored. So with the current rules a Pig in the farm is four points per city.

Respuesta 4:
Actually, this farming conundrum applies only for the American versions of Carcassonne. The 3rd edition scoring (3 points/farm) was introduced there with almost a decade long delay in relation to Europe. Now, the 3rd edition's rules are valid worldwide, but, I suppose, some older expansions (and T&B is an old expansion) were published in America in accordance with the old rules 4 points/farm).

It's true First Edition if you are scoring each City just once - to the Farmer that supplies it the most (has the most Followers on fields that touch the City), and giving 4 points per City.

I don't have the original game, so I can't check, but it may have had the first-edition rules, but we had knowledge of the newer rules, and they made more sense. We did not realize the difference of 3 vs 4 points though.

But these hybrid rules have worked for us very well, even with the addition of the scribe(?) and Inns. We still don't need to rush conquering the fields, we need to grab the points we can (and preserve and recycle meeples), then race to get the majority in the fields before the game (and suitable tiles) run out. A big field can have 4+ meeples or meeple-equivalents from 2 or 3 players by the end of the game. Usually just 3 though.

You may have got this backward. I believe it was RGG that was trying to hang on to the First Edition rules while HiG adopted the Second, then Third Editions. RGG finally relented fearing too much confusion with new expansions being introduced which relied on Third Edition scoring - such as the Barn introduced in the Abbey & Mayor expansion. It would have been a monumental task to attempt to keep two parallel rule sets going.

But the point is valid. You could be playing a Third Edition came with an expansion with a rulebook that was printed in First Edition - and you would likely find discrepancies. Because of the evolution of the rules and the many varied expansions with varying release dates the CAR was born (Complete Annotated Rules). The CAR almost perfectly marries all the latest rules of the base game, all known FAQ and all expansions into a coordinated master set of rules. The definitive answers to rules questions come directly from the various publishers and are collected succinctly into the CAR.

I highly recommend it to anyone playing the game as a master reference that can be relied on in place of any rulebook they may currently have, especially if trying to coordinate it with any of the expansions.

Welcome to the Geek! In general, you can find the quickest response by going to the page of the game you are talking about and posting in that game's forums. Carcassonne can be found by clicking that link.

As for your question, I'm not sure I understand. In general, you are NOT allowed to place a meeple on a feature that already has a meeple on it - even your own. So if I place a knight in a city, I cannot place another knight in the same city. I can place a knight in an adjacent city and then try to connect the two cities. But you cannot place a meeple where a meeple already exists - even if that meeple is your own.

Moved to Carcassonne : Rules.

Respuesta 5:
ok, i'm more confused, now.

If two roads are unconnected, one owned by red and one by blue, neither red or blue are able to beef up their meeple placement on their own roads?

then, if those roads become joined by a cleverly placed tile, who gets the points?

I just started playing games, btw.

Respuesta 6:
Good questions, and you're about to break into the reason why Carcassonne is so fun.

A maximum of one meeple is allowed to be placed on any distinct/separate "feature" (castle, road, farm... monastery, of course).

Through clever tile placement, you may join two like features (join two roads, as your example in the original post). In your example of the joined road, red and blue would both get points for the road. In a two player game, one player was likely trying to eliminate the potential points that the other player would score by finishing a road of considerable length (because now both players get them). In a 3+ player game, red and blue get those points, leaving out the other colors (i.e. "let someone do a lot of work, and then sneak onto their feature to score their points with them").

Consequently: red or blue is upset that the road has been merged, and wants to sneak ANOTHER meeple on to the road by an additional tile placement (e.g. start a 2nd road -- as the original red road and original blue road have now been joined into one red/blue road, and hope to eventually join that 2nd road). If red can sneak another meeple on there, and maintain that lead of two red meeples vs. one blue meeple, red will get ALL the points for the road (the player with the most meeples on a feature receives 100% of the points).

In a three player game, there is often an arms race for a monster-castle between two players. A smart third player may choose to stay out of it, instead racking up smaller completed features while the other two duke it out. That third player should make efforts to prevent the other players from finishing the castle (making it impossible through clever tile placement, etc.).

I would say fighting over the majority in large farms is one of the trickier, but most safisfying!, parts of the game. Watch out for those grassy areas (monastery, etc.) that can connect two previously separate farms.

I hope that helps.

Edit: Now you can imagine why one of the expansions adds a "big meeple", which counts as two meeples when scoring any feature. That's a fun twist after you've played the base game a bit more. There is quite a bit of replayability with what you have, though.

Respuesta 7:
that explains it perfectly.

thanks!



Tema 263: Farm Scoring: list of different rules for Carc family of games?

I understand the farm scoring rules, at least in English, have changed from time to time both in Carc itself and maybe in the expansions & maybe in the stand-alone games.

Respuesta 1:
While I don't have an answer about farms, the search "farm -re" works for me. But usually, I go with Google anyhow.

Respuesta 2:
Not sure what you are trying to do with a search and why you are excluding "Re"

In essence, it boils down to 1st edition and 3rd edition scoring. 2nd edition made some changes but is basically what is in 3rd edition now. 4th edition is the current way and is just RGG getting caught up with 4th edition.

In first edition, Farms weren't actually scored. You looked to each city and determined who controlled each field. Whoever controlled the most farms go the 4 points for that city. the same farm - if it touched multiple cities - could score many times since it was lending weight to each city that scored in this manner.

In third edition, farms were treated more like the other features. You went field by field and determined majority. Then for each completed city you receive 3 points. So each farm only score once and the cities could contribute points to multiple fields.

When the pig came out, it added 1 addition point per scoring regardless of which method you used. barns also affected it and really is what forced RGG to adopt 3rd edition rules (effectively making 4th edition rules)

The river is supposed to be played first. When you run out of the river tiles, you start drawing the normal tiles.

We play in a way that the pool/lake at the end of the river is placed automatically, then the next player in turn gets the black normal starting tile to place as they see fit.

Respuesta 2:
The river tiles have the back of the starting tile because they are intended to replace it if you prefer a bigger starting space. When playing with river, remove the all-land starting tile and have players start with drawing and playing river tiles (followers placement allowed of course) and once they run out, move to remaining land tiles.

Respuesta 3:
The River (I or II) is definitely not intended to be shuffled with the other tiles. There are even some extra rules to keep the river from ending early or being impossible to complete. The Count mini-expansion also replaces the starting tile and has that darker back as well.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks a lot guys! Our copy didn't have extra rules for the rivers so we had no idea how to use them and just shuffled them in.

Played a quick game according to the rules you are talking about and it finally all made sense We used to have gaps everywhere because of the rivers.

Thanks again.

Tema 265: Big Box 4 scan of English rules
Pregunta:
Hi guys,

Looking for a little favour. I bought the German version of Big Box 4 from Amazon (hey, what can I say, it was £40), but am looking for an English scan of the rulebook.

It's the set with the main game plus:

Inns & Cathedrals
Traders & Builders
Plus 7 mini expansions including the Crop Circles expansion.
The Flying Machines
The Messengers
The Ferries
The Gold Mines
Mage & Witch
The Robbers

I don't suppose any one has a UK manual and would mind scanning it in and sending a link (or else posting a link where it already exists).

I've found a few links through searching but, so far, they are for older versions.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Tema 266: Farmer placement in field w/pre-existing meeple
Pregunta:
Hello!

I did a quick search of the forums, but couldn't find a satisfactory answer. Sorry if it's a newb question, but I just got the game recently and we can't quite figure the farmer placement out.

Question:

If Player 1 puts a farmer in a field, does this mean nobody else can place a farmer in that same field for the rest of the game?

If the answer to the above is 'yes', then why do the rules provide an example of how to score a field with multiple farmers?

The example image in the rules makes it seem like you cannot place a farmer adjacent or in the same row of tiles, but any other placement in the same field is okay... is this correct?

Thanks in advance!

Respuesta 1:
No. You cannot place a farmer in a field already having a farmer. The reason the rule is there is separate fields containing farmers can be connected once other tiles are placed. We called it sneaking a farmer in.

No, there is no restriction on rows etc.
The only restriction is as James explains above, you can join two separate fields with farmers already on them into a single large field.

Farms are no different from any other feature in this regard, but they do get confusing as they are often such large and sprawling features.

if your new box matches my older one then there are two rules sheets included; a four page primary, plus a double-sided supplement. Both contain explanations of how extra Farmers can legally be accomplished.

In the primary rule description, the middle image of 3 in a row, in the Final Scoring section is about Farmers. Notice the statement, "X indicates the order the tiles were placed." The 5th tile joins 3 Farmers (2 Red, 1 Yellow) that were previously not connected.

The supplement is more explicit, in a final section titled How can there be more than 1 farmer on a farm, where images show the sequence of 3 turns separately that result in joining a Red and a Blue Farmer. Here there is also the guidance that "In the same way, players can have 2 or more knights in a City and 2 or more thieves on a road."

Tema 267: Stealing a city with a tower and claiming it. Carcassonne
Pregunta:
Okay. Say I occupy a city that is one tile away from being done. However, on the next turn, my opponent pulls a piece with a tower foundation on it that can steal my meeple and complete the city. Would my opponent be able to score that city or would no one score it because he decided to use a tower piece?

Your question is a bit open ended as we don't know who else is in the city or what other expansions are being used.

But by him placing the tower piece, he could capture your piece (by what you are saying). So that meeple is no longer in the city.

The city is now finished by placement of this last tile. So the city would be scored as normal. If no meeples are in the city, 0 points are awarded.

Respuesta 2:
With the tower expansion, you either place a tower piece OR a follower. So he could place a tower that would capture you, but then he gives up the ability to place a follower that turn, so the city would go unclaimed.

Respuesta 3:
As well, can you steal back your own meeple with a tower?

Respuesta 4:
You can't "steal" back your own meeple. Though technically you would if you capture the meeple of the player who has previously captured yours.

So let's say BLUE builds a tower and captures YELLOW. Later YELLOW builds a tower and captures BLUE. The two players now essentially participate in a "prisoner exchange" and both get their meeples back.

Respuesta 5:
As for the first question:

On turn k your opponent steals your meeple from a nearly finished city and imprisons it in a tower. Then on turn k+1 three situations are possible
(assume that originally there was only one your meeple in that city):

a) you draw a tile that allows you to finish a city and you have a spare meeple = you score for the city
b) the opponent draws the tile that finishes a city and places a meeeple = he or she scores for the city

c) no one finishes the city or places a meeple there = the city isn't scored

Just remember the basic rule - first place a tile, then place a meeple and score at the end.

As for the second question:

You can't steal back an imprisoned meeple of yours because your opponent places it in his/her reserve and not on the tower. There are two ways to reclaim an imprisoned meeple: (i) when you also have a meeple belonging to your opponent meeple, both of you must exchange prisoners. (ii) you can pay the ransom to get your meeple back. Putting a meeple on top of the tower is something else. It's an action YOU (and not your opponent) do, to prevent the tower from growing and your opponent from stealing another of your meeples that is valuable to you. The meeple on the tower stays there until the end of the game unles it's eaten by the dragon or captured by another tower (the latter action is performed by your opponent).

Respuesta 6:
I don't think people are understanding what I'm asking. Say I have my meeple on a city that I know I can't complete, and there's a tower within distance that I can take my own meeple back, why can't I do that?

As well, I don't think the dragon can steal a meeple that is on top of a tower, correct me if I'm wrong. I'd like to see that rule. And I don't think you can steal another opponents meeple that has been placed on a tower. Show me if I'm wrong.

Of course, you can take your own follower back as a "prisoner".

The rule from the tower - BigBox1(see the sentence in bold):
"When a player takes an opponent’s follower as prisoner, he places it in his play area. When a player takes his own follower as prisoner, he places it in his supply. When a player’s last thief, knight, or farmer is taken from a road or
city with his builder or a field with his pig, he removes the builder or pig, returning it to his supply."

Rohill Hillro
@robertnhill
As well, I don't think the dragon can steal a meeple that is on top of a tower, correct me if I'm wrong. I'd like to see that rule...

The dragon is always hungry. A tower is no problem for the dragon. The dragon can eat the follower on the top of a tower. Only the fairy on the same tile like the follower (may be on the top of a tower) can stop the dragon.

The rule for the dragon (BigBox1):
"Also, the dragon will never move to the tile where the fairy stands. Whenever the dragon visits a tile with a follower, a builder, or a pig, the player whose figure stands on the tile, takes the follower, builder, or pig from the tile, returning it to his supply."

Some more rules in German (from the HiG-Homepage):
• Der Drache entfernt folgende Figuren, wie normale Gefolgsleute vom Spielfeld: Großer Gefolgsmann (1.Erw.), Schwein und Baumeister (2.Erw.), Gefolgsmann auf Turm (4.Erw), Bürgermeister und Wagen (5.Erw.).

The translation:
The dragon removes following figures like the normal follower from the playing field: big follower, pig and builder, follower on the top of a tower, mayor and wagon.

Rohill Hillro
@robertnhill
...And I don't think you can steal another opponents meeple that has been placed on a tower. Show me if I'm wrong.
You can steal another opponents follower on a tower, if your tower is higher with enough reach.

The rule for the tower (BigBox1)
"Place a follower on a tower
When a player places a follower on a tower, the tower is completed and may not be further heightened. This follower remains on the tower until the end of the game, unless it is removed by the dragon or is taken prisoner by another player when he places a tower piece on another tower. A player takes this action to protect other followers of his in the area of the tower."

I don't know this part of the rule from the tower.

The original rule from the German publisher Hans-im-Glück (HiG) has been changed in the first Big Box (BigBox1) in 2006. The same rule I have found in the English BigBox1 rule from RioGrandeGames.

Edit: The Complete Annotated Rules follows the BigBox rule.

Tema 268: Placing a second meeple in an already occupied city that you own - Carcassonne
Pregunta:
Hi. Maybe I'm a complete idiot but quick question. Say I have a two tiled city being built (or a road) and I have my meeple on it. If I draw another tile that directly attaches to my already occupied city that I own, can I lay another meeple of that so that I'd now have a three tiled city with two meeples, therefore making it harder for my opponent to take over my city?

I'm asking this because I have Carcassonne on my iPhone and every time I want to lay another meeple on a city that I already own, it won't let me unless I indirectly lay another city piece that on a further turn connect them.

Hoping someone can help!

Respuesta 1:
You are not allowed to do so. You may only place a meeple on a feature, in this case a castle, if there isn't already a meeple on it.

Respuesta 2:
Even if I own it myself??

Respuesta 3:
The phone app is correct. You can't put a meeple on a directly connected road or city piece, even if the existing meeple is your own.

Quoting this just to underline how important this is when playing to the official rules. Adding another meeple directly to a structure you own is not allowed and what you need to do is join structures together and so combine your forces to guard this city or road.

'Sliding' into an opponent's structure by joining your structure to theirs is crucial in a cut-throat game, especially with some of the expansions!

Tema 269: Question regarding fields.
Pregunta:
My wife and I own the Z-man edition of Carcassonne (With Rivers) and have a question about fields.

I have won the last two games by a large margin by not forgetting about farmers in the field and gaining points for 5-7 completed cities.

My wife thinks I am making a mistake regarding field boundaries.

The way I see it is that a fields boundary consists of:
Roads
City walls
The board edges (Upto a city wall in a corner or where a road would leave)

This can potentially lead to a massive field.
Am I making a mistake?

Thank you in advance!

Respuesta 1:
Sounds correct to me.

Fields can really turn a game around (I routinely pick up 30+ points from field(s) at the end of the game).

Respuesta 2:

Our field scoring gives points to both/all if the field is tied, just like with cities. Only if you have a majority, you get the points and other farmers get nothing.

Yep. Both players score the points in a tie. The net result means that neither player gains a point advantage over the other, but both still score the points. This is especially important in a 3+ player game. The two players with farmers in the field get points while the other players do not. If the tied players scored no points, it would put them on the same level as the players that did not have farmers in the field and that would greatly diminish the importance of putting farmers in fields.

Wooden bridges from the expansion don't split fields. This rule is written in a leaflet from the Bridges… expansion itself (Croatian) .

Farme i gradovi pod mostovima nisu razdijeljeni. → The farms and cities under the bridges are not divided.

Drawn bridges (drawn on tiles) do split fields. This rule is written in a leaflet from Traders and Builders expansion (English) .

The fields are separated by the bridge.



Tema 270: Castles scoring question
Pregunta:
Player plays a city tile with multiple single city pieces and completes two separate cities. One is a 2-tile city, and thus can be played as a Castle instead. If the player claims that as a Castle while simultaneously completing an adjacent city, can he get the points for the adjacent city as his completion of the castle?

The rulebook says that a castle scores for the "next completed" points in one of the 6 hexes (two with the castle and two adjacent). Since it's simultaneous, technically the city wouldn't be "next." That's my interpretation, but I'm open to another point of view.

Respuesta 1:
The player gets to place a meeple after placing the tile. If the player places the meeple on the 2-tile just completed city, that gets scored. If the player does not have any meeple(s) on the other city he/she also completed when placing that tile, then the other city does not get scored. If the other city contains a meeple belonging to another player, then the completed city gets scored (for the other player).

Respuesta 2:
This is taken from the Complete Annotated Rules file v 6.2:

Quote:
The RGG version of the rules states that the castle scores only “when the first feature … in

that the castle is built does not allow the castle to score.

Thanks. Makes sense.

It was my 7 year-old son who wanted to take the castle. The adjacent city was a 30-pointer with a Cathedral that he and I already shared. I really wanted him to get the points for the 30-pointer with the Castle, but didn't think that was right. While I may not always play as aggressively with my kids as I do with adults, I don't want to bend the rules in their favor since they'll remember those rules.

German rules:
Quote:
Der Spieler bekommt
dann Punkte, wenn das erste Bauwerk (Stadt, Straße oder Kloster)

The player scores when the first feature (city, street or cloister) is closed in a later turn. So you cannot build a castle and score for it in the same turn.

As a cautionary tale, we tried to do an every expansion game at BGG.Con last year (including homemade Windrose and La Porxada tiles). It was more an epic slog than an epic game for us. Too many symbols to keep track of, too much having to look things up, too many bits of wood, too many rules. We stopped less than a third of the way through the tiles. There were multiple expansions in play that none of us had used before though, so I think it might have been better if we'd played through at least 1 game of base + expansion for every expansion first so we could know them better.

Perhaps you've already got this covered or you're made of sterner stuff than us though - if so, good luck! I'd love to see a picture of the final map and read a session report.

Yes... and it would be even longer and sloggier with some of my friends who always seem to get stuck in Analysis Paralysis trying to determine the absolute BEST location to maximize points for each tile they place.

How many Meeples, ahh-hem Followers do you need? First of all we've discarded the "Race Track" scoring board, preferring the simple Paper and Pencil method; this allows the 8th Meeple Follower to jump into the pool and join the game. Secondly, there's The Big Guy Meeple Follower to overpower your opponent on those contested features. Third: if you're using all the expansions, then you also got The Mayor Meeple Follower and The Wagon thingy which also acts like a Meeple Follower. Finally: we love The Phantom Meeple Follower, with the way it can jump on and off the map board to score a few quick points on small completed features, while you simultaneously use the normal ones to build the larger towns and roads. We're already up to TWELVE pawns to p lay the game with, plus the Builder, Pig, and Barn for their bonnuses. One more and we'll have enough for a   set.

But I must admit that if I don't p lay my Cards Tiles correctly, even 12 of them sometimes doesn't seem like enough.

Respuesta 6:
Well, I'd say it is cheating to use the eighth follower. Like it or not, the game is designed to be played with seven. With all expansions included, you get the Big Follower, Mayor, Wagon, and Phantom. I don't think there are any others that classify as Followers. You also have Robbers, Builders, Wagons, Pigs, and the Fem-Follower, but all of those are placed elsewhere and don't count. Definitely a lot of pieces, but they still can only be used one at a time.



Tema 272: Confused about multiple meeples on the same city
Pregunta:
Just got the game and love it just one question,How do you or the opponent place more then one meeple on a city xince you cant place a meeple on an adjacent tile??..can another meeple only be place on corner city tiles?..and does that go for you and the other player since I understand it may help to have more then one meeple on a completed city..but how can this work??where do u place the other meep thx

Respuesta 1:
You place a meeple on a city tile that is close to the city you want to connect to and try to connect it later.That is how multiple meeples can end up in the same city.

Respuesta 2:
You cannot place a meeple on an already taken city. But you can have spearate (non-finished) cities, each with a meeple, that later in the game are joined and become one big city with more than one meeple on it.

Respuesta 3:
Examine the last page of the rules supplement to see an example. Look for the section title, "How can there be more than 1 farmer on a farm?"

The exlanation that goes with the diagrams ends with this sentence, "In the same way, players can have 2 or more knights in a City and 2 or more thieves on a road."

Respuesta 4:
You are basically joining 2 cities that each have a meeple (knight) in it, this works no matter who's meeple is in each city, if they are both yours you know have a city with 2 meeples in it and you score as normal if and when it is closed, if you join a city containing your knight with a city that contains an opponents knight you both score the full point value for the city, you do not split points.
If you manage to get a city closed with more knights in it than your opponent you score all the points and your opponents score nothing.

Respuesta 5:
Then, if I end up having 2 meeples on the same city without any opponent meeples, will the score be doubled for that city?

I am confused.

Respuesta 6:
No. The player who has most meeples scores. Let's say the city is worth 10 points (4 tiles + 1 shield). You can get only 10 points, no matter how many meeples you have in it. The majority rule only tells you WHO scores for the city, and NOT HOW MANY POINTS.

So, if you have 1 meeple in that city, you score 10 pts, if you have 2 meeples, your opponent 0, you score 10 pts. If you have 2 meeples, your opponent 1, you score 10 pts. If both of you have 1 meeple, both of you earn 10 pts. If no one has a meeple in the city, no one scores 10 pts. The value of the city doesn't change. You must only decide, who'll score these points. And that's what the majority rule is for.

No. You cannot place a meeple on that particular feature of the tile if it establishes a connection to an occupied feature. You can place the meeple on that tile on some other unclaimed (whether "connected" or not) feature.

Yes.

If the tile you've just placed has a city segment which connects to another city on one side, it is immediately part of that city. If there is already a meeple in that city, you cannot add a meeple to it. And the same is true, of course, for roads and fields.

Answering to your question: there is a tie, as [the big meeple] = 2× [meeple]. (They both get points for that city – in case of finishing the city in that state).
Commenting the case: the only situation of two meeples from one player being in the same city can occur only when the player placed one meeple in a city, then placed another meeple in another city, then joined the cities. You *cannot* place a meeple in a city where there already is a meeple (whatever player they belong to – you or another player).

When scoring a feature where a large meeple is present, the large meeple is worth
2 normal meeples. (It is as thick as two meeples!)

I have a question for the community!

If they are only touching at a corner, they are not connected. So you can place meeples in these unconnected tiles and hope to connect them later and muscle them out with a greater majority (or just share the points).

Respuesta 2:
Yes you can place a meeple on a tile that touches the city with a corner. You can't do it if the city segments on adjacent tiles (left/rigth up/down) are linked and make a single city.

Respuesta 3:
If only the corners are touching then they are still considered 2 cities so, you can place your meeple. The cities would have to be connected by a common side in order to be considered a single city.

Respuesta 4:
In the example of a city, if the diagonally touching tiles are not connecting the city in any other way than you can place a meeple on your tile with the potential to connect them and contend for the city points.

Tema 275: OK, ok, one more noob question...
Pregunta:
It's tough to ask this without a visual example to refer to, so, be merciful...

If one player somehow has, at the end of the game, multipe farmers of the same color on the same farm (the farm got really big, with porous borders),

--and there are no other farmers of any other color on the farm --

--does the player still get just 3 points per completed city (because multiple farmers don't count if there all the same color)?

Or, does each farmer continue to rack up points for the player?

i.e. three yellow farmers are the only ones present on a farm that touches four completed cities.

The player scores 12 points? Or 36 points?

This scenario came up in our game the other night, and we decided on the former, rather than the later way of scoring points. Correct?

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
The former is correct. You can never score more than 3 points per completed city (although some of the expansions have ways to do that).

Respuesta 2:
Only 12 points. No value in having extra farmers on a field.

Respuesta 3:
A farm is only scored once regardless of how many farmers there are of one color.

Respuesta 4:
Farms, cities, roads -- it doesn't matter what the feature is, the player with the most meeples on it gets the points. How many meeples are present makes no difference except for deciding who has the most.

So if you had one meeple on a farm with 3 cities and no-one else had any meeples there, you'd score 9 points. If you had 4 meeples on it, you'd still score 9 points unless someone else had more than 4 meeples on that farm.

And of course if two players have the same number of meeples they both score the full points, so if you had 4 and I had 4 we'd both score 9 points.

Respuesta 5:
No extra points for the additional farmers, they will only come into play if someone else is trying to contest your farm, then its majority rules.

Respuesta 6:
You score 36 points unless the rulebook says different...

Oh, look! The rulebook says different! You have one of those, right?

Pg 4: FARMER SCORING (for supplying the completed cities)
"• For each city a farm supplies, the player who deployed the most
farmer(s) in the farm earns 3 points, regardless of the size of the
city. If players tie with the most farmers, each scores 3 points."

Tema 276: "Best" place for tiles -- road, city or field?
Pregunta:
Hello, my nine-year-old and I got this for Christmas and we've played just two games so far.

Here's our question -- when placing a new tile (which you have just drawn)how do you agree on what its best placement may be?

For example, if the tile has a road, field and city on it, (and at that moment in the game, you can only place it next to another road or city tile on the board) which feature takes priority?

I thought maybe the road, because matching the tile to another road is usually always an option and would be preferable to having a bunch of unfinished roads going this way and that.

My son disagreed, arguing that the tile should go wherever it is best for the player, regardless of aesthetics, etc.

I guess what I'm really wondering is, are you supposed to make a logical move with your tile, or throw it down anywhere it is legal to do so?

The part in the rulebook about people making suggestions is tongue-in-cheek. You lay the tile wherever you want to lay it strategically (which means a lot of "blocked" roads and cities that are unfinished with meeples stuck on them by the end of the game)

Respuesta 2:
The tongue-in-cheek rule is there to prevent the game from becomming a boring serious game where everybody is playing in silence.

It is quite fun to convince a fellow player to lure him away from the obvious move to ruin my situation by 'convincing' him to annoy someone else instead.

As for which feature of a tile you should go for, it really depends upon the situation. But all things being equal the city is at minimum worth the same as the road, but potentially twice as much (and even more when containing shields), so going for cities is the most valuable.

Yes, definitely. Certainly something has to be unfinished, either cities, or roads, or farms. The map will eventually have edges, each tile's-worth of which is one of these three things. (We usually have a few unfinished cloisters as well, and often there are holes in the middle of the map where no tile will fit.)

Respuesta 3:
1) That's just the maximum time we play at home, but a full game (so far) has not been longer than an hour

2) Some of the people I game with need to place the tile on the table first before deciding if that's the move they wish to make. So to allow them to do this we use the 2 minute time limit and providing they have not scored the tile (completing a road or city for example) then they can move it to another location if they like.

But there are certain expansions where it makes a big difference whether you draw your next tile before the previous player(s) have completed their turn.

The biggest example I can think of is Traders and Builders. If one of the players adds on to a feature with Bob (the builder meeple), they can draw and play another tile. So there is a chance that they could have drawn the tile that you drew out of turn.

Also with the Princess and the Dragon if the dragon is required to move on another player's turn, knowledge of your next tile might influence where you want to move the dragon.

Suppose, a two player game and that you need one specific tile. Suppose this is your opponent's turn and there are n tiles in the bag. If you do not allow your opponent to pick in advance, then you have a probability of 1/n to pick the tile you need. Otherwise, if he picks a tile for his next turn before you pick yours, then you probability of getting the needed tile can be calculated as follows: the probability, that your opponent doesn't pick the tile you need is (n-1)/n times the probability that if your opponent doesn't pick the tile and you do is 1/(n-1):

(n-1)/n * 1/(n-1)= 1/n. It is still the same probability.

I know this is a much simplified situation, but I believe similar calculations with analogous results can be done in every other case. The only case when it matters is if there is a possibility that someone might be able to pick several tiles in one turn (as with builder) and this might change when the game ends.

Let me put it this way:

Let's say you're one of six people drawing straws. Each of you has the same chance (one in six) of drawing the short straw.

But if four people have already drawn their straws, then one of them may have already drawn the short straw! If so, you have no chance of drawing the short straw.

But it doesn't matter. Your overall chance of drawing the short straw is one in six. Which order you pick them makes no difference to that.

Maybe it's because I'm rusty in that department, but shouldn't your chance of picking up the short straw decrease as the players before you chooses their straws and it's not the short one?

If two before me picks up two straws that aren't the shortest one (let's assume we can know), then shouldn't my chance of picking up the shortest one now be 1 in 4 and not 1 in 6?

Yes -- now. But it doesn't matter, because when you agree to draw straws, all six of you have the same chance to draw the short straw. The order you pick straws in doesn't make any difference to that.

I think you're confusing yourself by imagining a situation partway through and treating that as if it was the whole situation.


Let's take another more relevant example:

We're playing Carcassonne using Traders & Builders. You are just about to place a tile which will activate your builder, giving you an extra turn. There are 2 tiles left, A & B. Whichever of us draws A will gain enough points to win the game, and whichever draws B will lose.

Does it matter whether I draw for my next turn now, leaving you one tile, or whether you take your turn and then draw for your extra turn, leaving me one tile? Either way, we both have a 50% chance of drawing tile A.

Of course, once one of us has picked, the other has either a 0% or 100% chance of picking tile A. But it doesn't actually matter which order we pick, because the overall chance is 50%.

(edited for typos)
You are correct with you example. The chance to draw the short straw in fact increases, if other players draw the long straws, and drops to 0 if any one before you gets the short one.

However, what we are saying is this: if you have six people drawing six straws. Before anyone begins, there is a 1/6 chance of you (or any other player) drawing a short straw. It doesn't depend on the order of the draw: if you draw first, you have 1/6 chance of getting the short one, also if you draw the last you have a probability of 1/6 to be left with the short one.

This is the same for Carcassone: if you are left with n tiles and need one precise tile, then you have 1/n probability of drawing it and it doesn't differ weather you draw the first, the second or the last one. If your opponent draws first and gets another tile, then your chances increase and the probability of you being successful is 1/(n-1), however your opponent has a very slight (1/n) chance of getting the tile you need and overall this all evens out.

EDIT: Ups, Mark explained the same earlier...

Indeed, I was just telling myself the last two tiles situation before I read yours and you're right, it is still 50/50.

But it still feels like you get less chance of getting it. Let's say we're 4 and there's 5 tiles left and I play a builder, the chance of getting the tile I want when there's 4 tiles left seems grander than when there will be only one left. Even though it is still up to the probability, it feels like I have more control over my faith if I pick and there's 4 tiles left rather than pick the one that's left.

I suppose it's all about perception... Thanks (both Juliusan and xipuloxx) for your help, sorry to be a stickler on that one.

If you get more times of the tile that you wanted when you pick first, then, yeah your reasoning is valid, you are obviously more "lucky" than the other person. And don't play RFTG.



Tema 278: Can I score immediatly after placing a tile and meeple on it?
Pregunta:
Hi, it seems to me that if I complete a road/city/etc and in this same turn I place a meeple on that last tile I can immediatly score and regather my meeple. I've just started to play and some of my friends thinks that I can't do this. Who is right? ^^

Thank you!

Respuesta 1:
You are correct.

Respuesta 2:
Yes you can. A turn order goes like this:
1. Place a tile
2. Place a meeple (optional)
3. Score a completed feature, which returns any meeples on those features.

So if you place a meeple on your tile on a feature that you just completed with that tile, then he comes back right away.

Do note that if yo do not have any extra meeples on hand, that you can't score a feature to get one back and then place it. Placing always comes before scoring.

Respuesta 3:
Basically, although there is more to this when using other expansions, it goes:

1. Place tile
2. Move the wood (place a meeple to the just played tile)
3. Score completed features.

So yes, you can place a meeple to the tile just placed and score for the completed feature on the same turn.

Respuesta 4:
You are right.
Nothing is scored until you place the meeple.
As long as the road/city/etc that you have just completed has no other meeples on it (i.e. if you could legally place a meeple on it if it wasn't finished), you can place your meeple on it, score it and immediately regain your meeple.

Of course, your friends can do that too...

Respuesta 5:
Remember that you always:

(i) play the tile you've drawn

(ii) if possible, you place a meeple on that tile

(iii) if any feature is finished by playing that tile, you immediately score it

(iv) you can reclaim a meeple from a finished structure


So, playing the tile that closes an unoccupied city, placing the follower on it, scoring the city, and getting the follower back to your reserve is correct.

Respuesta 6:
Thank you very much guys! Seemed obvious to me too!

Respuesta 7:
You are spot on, if you complete a road, place a meeple on it, score it and take you meeple back.

this would also apply to cities as well.

Tema 280: Volcano Tile & Barn
Pregunta:
Hi everyone,

Played some Carc this weekend and we mixed it up using a few different extensions and during our last session in which we used the Princess & the Dragon along with Abbey & Mayors, we stumble upon a scenario that spur much debate. We had both English and French rules along with the annotated rules and we still couldn't find a straight answer.

The issue resolves around placing a volcano tile in which you must move the dragon to this tile and you cannot place a follower (in English they refer to a figure) on such tile, but because they do not explicitly say that you miss your turn, one of our player placed his barn in the corner. That played an even bigger role since Barns are spared by the dragon.

So the question is, can you place a barn after placing a volcano tile? In the end we concluded that you cannot, but we didn't have a clear 100% for sure answer.

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
Page 48 of Complete Annotated Rules v 6.2:

Question: May the barn be placed on a tile with a volcano? Answer: Yes.

Remember that the barn is not a follower but a figure (like the pig and builder; however these two can't be placed on a volcano tile).

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for the quick response, but to refer to my original issue, it would seems that the answer is no?

Perhaps my question was vague? Can you place the barn after you put down the volcano tile, on your same turn? The annotated rules (which I had an outdated one ) seems to refer to a subsequent turn.

Respuesta 3:
Mr. Burn
@carcassebs
Can you place the barn after you put down the volcano tile, on your same turn?
OK, after re-reading that section of the annotated rules, it seems like we did the right thing, when you play a volcano tile, you can only move the dragon and potentially the fairy, that is it. Afterwards you can put a barn in a corner of a volcano tile.

Thanks!

Respuesta 4:
It is possible (or at least a common interpretation of this rule allows to place a barn by the player who just played the volcano tile). I've just checked it on a free java version: http://jcloisterzone.com/en/, and such a move was possible there.

However, according to the annotated rules, I'd lean towards your interpretation.

Respuesta 5:
I tend to agree with both of you.

The rules are rather confusing on this point, but the CAR's interpretation (that the barn cannot be placed on the volcano tile in that turn, but can be placed there later) makes sense to me.

By the way, this thread links to the latest version of the CAR .

Respuesta 6:
Could someone post a list of all the (official) tiles where I cannot place a meeple on during that turn according to official rules, or is just the volcano tiles?

Respuesta 7:
When you play a volcano tile, you have to move the dragon on it and since you cannot play a figure, you may move the fairy to one of your followers. Nothing else is allowed on that turn.

As far as I can remember, it's just the volcano tiles (and the starting tile). There may be another expansion that has tiles you can't place anything on, but if so I don't think I'm aware of it.

Respuesta 9:
Oh sorry, I read your question wrong.

There's another possibility that I can think of and it's in the same expansion. If you put a tile with a princess in a city that already has other meeple (which mean you will boot one out), you cannot add a figure to that tile.



Tema 281: Question on Rule - Placing Meeple you don't have
Pregunta:
HI everyone.
I wanted to clarify a rule with everyone. I was playing some Carcassonne online and noticed I couldn't do the following.

I had no meeples in my inventory. However there was a meeple on a city that was nearly complete. The tile I drew would complete the city. It also had a road component on the tile. I wanted to use the meeple that I would have received from the completed city and place it on the road. But the online version of the game didn't let me use that Meeple.

Is that just the way the game was programmed, or can you use a meeple you just won back and place it on somewhere else?

Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
We've always played it that you CAN re-place that meeple. If that's not correct, I don't want to hear it.

Respuesta 2:
no you can't

your turn is these steps in this order:
- lay a tile
- place a meeple
- collect score

so if the meeple isn't in your inventory at step 2, you cannot place.

cheers

now if you want to play in a way the online won't...play with three tiles in hand...awesome.

Respuesta 3:
Short answer: No, you must use an available meeple from your supply.

Longer answer:

There is a distinct sequence to play.

Place the new tile
You may (depending on the tile placement, i.e. you can't add to a road where somebody including yourself already has a meeple) place a meeple from your supply on the new tile
Score any features completed by the tile placement in step This may free up meeples, but since this is step they are not available for placement on the new tile.

Respuesta 4:
Here are the rules and they must be carried out in that order:

i) The player must draw and place a new land tile.
ii) The player may deploy one of his followers from his supply to the land tile he just placed.
iii) If, by placing the land tile, cloisters, roads, and/or cities are completed, they are now scored.

It therefore means you cannot do what you wrote above.

Respuesta 5:
Sorry, you only get your meeple back *after* scoring, so you cannot use it on a tile you have placed earlier that round. For this reason I always try to make sure I have a meeple in hand. It is also useful for those quick scoring oportunities where you can "meeple on, meeple off" on a small feature that hasn't been claimed (e.g. short roads or pastie cities).

Tema 282: Ferries expansion and reopening closed roads.
Pregunta:
Let's suppose that you place a ferry T-tile at the end of a road, completing it and allowing a player to score for that road.

The two other road directions on that ferry T-tile are still open, and you add a road tile to one of them. Wouldn't this reopen the road that had already been completed, creating the potential to score for that road again? (and again and again?)

I couldn't find any rules preventing you from re-opening a closed road, but it seems against the intent of the game.

Respuesta 1:
You are right. It's possible to score the same road up to 3-4 times (or even more) with the ferries (each time the road in question is a part of another road). I found a note on this issue in The complete annotated rules for Carcassonne:

''flip-flopping mechanic of the ferries can wreak havoc when using the Robber Baron, effectively allowing the road to be completed and re-opened mutiple times. Depending on your experiences, creation of a house rule may be necessary.''

Personally, I like this road flip-flopping. It makes roads much longer and drives fierce battles over them. This mini does add some chaos, but I don't think that it's against the general rules of the basic game. Generally, it's a good thing, because the roads in the basic game are least profitable features. The I&C and the Ferries (as well as the Bridges) make them more valuable.

Respuesta 2:
Erik C
@eriktheguy

Hmmm...

I tend to think this is exactly what this expansion was designed for; to create some real competition for valuable road spots. As the other poster notes it can create some serious competition for long roads.

What other intent would they have had in mind?

Respuesta 3:
I always though the Robber Baron counts roads that are completed at the end of the game. Not an expert on this though, I have the expansion but don't play with it.

But a ferry indeed can reopen a closed road - this gets most interesting when the road is quite long and/or has an inn somewhere - then it is possible to score this road several times.

Respuesta 4:
Okay, so sanity check complete, it can be done.

Any opponent could counter it by capping your road and cutting the ferry point off before allowing you to score. Capping the road with a ferry allows you to propagate this indefinitely.

Not sure what robber baron does. It it like a builder for roads? That might allow you to do some sick board control. In any case it seems like it's fairly easy to counter, and anyone can score from this strategy, so opening it up for yourself means also opening it up for other players.

Respuesta 5:
The Robber Baron comes together with the King mini expansion (also available as a part of Count, King & Consorts):

As soon as a player completes the first road, he or she should take the Robber Baron tile. If, during the course of play, another player completes a larger road — which means he or she places the final tile of this road —then he or she receives the Robber Baron. At the end of the game, the player in possession of the Robber Baron receives 1 point for every completed road.

Respuesta 6:
Erik C
@eriktheguy
... and anyone can score from this strategy, so opening it up for yourself means also opening it up for other players.
Exactly. So it is a bit of a two-edged sword to be wielded carefully lest you give your opponent the advantage you intended to take for yourself.

Respuesta 7:
I bought this last summer, and (at first) also thought you could reopen a road, but this is incorrect.

From the CAR:

"If a player places his landscape tile and extends a road that includes a ferry, the player may move the ferry, but he or she is not required to do so."

"The road must include a ferry to allow movement of that ferry in this situation. Thus, if adding onto a road that ends at a lake without the ferry connection, the ferry cannot be moved."

The ferries are the wooden pieces (not the tiles). If one is inside a completed road, and you can't add to a completed road, you can't move the ferry. This means that a ferry is locked in place when its road is completed.

Of course, there are always house rules. :-)

The way I imagined it, the road is completed by placing a ferry tile at one end, and placing the ferry so that it does not connect to the road, hence ending the road at the ferry tile. The road is then reopened by building on any of the directions from the ferry tile which the ferry connects to, and switching the ferry to connect the the previously completed road, and any open road.

Gotcha. That makes perfect sense, and I should know better, because I've done this several times. :-) I got your question completely backwards - sorry!

Hope ya'll arent confused by what I'm trying to say.

Thanks in advance.
If the feature on a tile that you just placed already had one or more meeples connected to it from previous tiles, you may not add a meeple to it. You must place it on an unconnected feature and hope it connects later in the game.

Stealing a large city or road by sneaking one of your Meeple onto it is either very satisfying or annoying depending on which side of the stealing you are on!

Tema 284: 2012 edition - Why does it say 4 points per farm?
Pregunta:
Hey all,

I just got Carcassonne as a present. Never played it before, I'm more into War of the Ring, Age of Empires, Agricola, and a bunch of other games. But have given it a shot anyway!

Fun enough so far, but I have a question about the farm scoring. From reading BGG and Wikipedia, it seems that from Editions 1 to 3, the farm scoring system has changed. Apparently now, the standard way is Edition 3, which is to score 3 points per completed city in/adjacent to your farm (for the player with the most owners in that farm).

How come my rule book included with the game says this is 4 points and not 3?

The rule book is copyright dated 2012, Hans im Gluck (ie not American publisher). It is the Finnish translated edition. There is no Edition number specified, but as it is dated 2012, I presume it is the latest! I know it doesn't make much difference, but it's nice to know.

Thanks for your help!

Respuesta 3:
The rules for farmer scoring (and from memory the two tile cities) have changed many times depending on which edition you are looking at. Unless you have a printed copy of what the definitive rules are, and given that at times the German and English rules were different my theory is you play with whatever is printed in the rules with the copy you are physically playing with. This was relevant to us because our set and a friend's set were different editions and thus had different farmer scoring.

Which version of the game do you have? I just checked the current Z-Man printing of the game and every instance of points when farmers are concerned is 3. I'm going to say that this current revision (Z-Man) is the rule set to go by, where farms are worth 3 points per city, even with a tie.

This has been discussed many times over. Number of turns has no bearing on ability to win. This is illustrated in all the numbers of players since 71 is not divisible evenly by 3, 4 or 5 either.

There are many times you draw a tile that has little use to you. The way to win the game is make the most efficient use of each tile you draw and to block your opponent when able (trapping a meeple in unfinished cities because there is no tile that can complete them).

Theoretically, if a 2p game were to be played where one player gets 2 back-to-back turns while p2 only got the usual 1 tile per turn, the results would be similar to a normal 2p game? This is taking it more extreme, but given what you've mentioned, it doesn't sound like it should make a difference.


On one hand, p2 could still try to utilize the "casted aside" tiles to get points, but OTOH, it seems there's alot of control in getting some of the right and wrong tiles (the "correct tiles" I suppose, to be more precise)?

Number of turns has no bearing on ability to win.
This seems like an extremely strong assertion to me.

If we play a game and I get 50 of the turns and you get 21, I'm probably going to win.

I could buy an argument that one extra turn would only give about a 3% point advantage, which might conceivably be a lot less than the effects of the random tile draw, but I'd still expect it to be there.

I could even buy an argument that the effect might be less than 3% because of some kind of second-player advantage.

But no advantage at all? Playing a standard 2-player game, if you were going first, would you lose anything by agreeing in advance to skip your last turn? Of course you would.

Please tell me how this is possible? Of course my argument becomes more "assertive" if you enter fanciful situations into the equation, taking it to an extreme that is not realistic.

At most, one player is going to have one more "round" than any other player. We aren't talking 50 to 21, we are talking 36-35. If we introduce the builder rule, you still have to set it up and are limited in the amount of turns you can take. Adding Traders gives you 24 more tiles. So 2 players would compete over 95 tiles but since you used 71 tiles as the basis, let's just stick with that. Draw 1, they would have to claim a tile with a meeple. Draw 2, they would have to place a builder. Draw 3 is the earliest they could start taking 2 tiles per round. So with 71 tiles and 2 rounds spent, 4 tiles are out of play, leaving only 67 tiles. If one player somehow managed to get the perfect tile to keep extending his builder's feature and the other sat on his hands, he would get 2/3 of those tiles. That would be 47 tiles to 24.

You are making some big assumptions that 1) One player won't challenge with his own builder 2) that the first player will have the perfect draw to always extend the builder's feature and 3) that he will never complete the feature the builder is on. Because each time he completes it, the builder is coming off. And even if he can claim the new feature right away, it will still take at least one turn before he gets the double tile bonus again. That decreases the disparity between the number of tiles drawn.

If Assumption 1 happens, then your opponent doesn't know how to play carcassonne. You should challenge them and get your own double tile turns. If you don't want the builder, you need to at least block theirs from doing anything.

Assumption 2 never happens from a practical stand point. I would say less than a third, maybe a fourth, of my draws result in a bonus draw because I am on a road when I get a building or on a building when I draw a road. Or when I get what I want, it doesn't fit the current situation. So in 36 rounds, I'd be lucky to see 8 or 9 rounds where I can pull the double tile.

But again, this is just talking about tiles. You are also assuming that each of these tiles is giving you some major point advantage but there is no guarantee that it is.

I don't know how you can calculate this as a 3% advantage. You are assuming each tile has an equal chance of scoring the same amount. That is completely false. Some tiles drawn will be worth zero points to you - because you can't extend something you own or you don't have a spare meeple to place. Some might be worth negative to you (giving your opponent more points than you) because you only have one legal play and it helps them more. On the other hand, it could be the perfect tile that gives you 30+ points because you completed that huge city with the cathedral. All tiles are not created equal.

Quote:

Sure you stand to lose something by skipping your last turn. But the majority of times it will be just a few points, not the game. I have rarely seen a game change hands because of the last tile.

So if you really want to offer some statistical analysis, you should see how many points each round nets you as you play the game. My guess is you will see a bell curve where the initial tiles net you no points (you are just beginning to claim tiles) and the final draws net you less points (as your options dry up and the chances of finding the perfect tile become less and less).

What you should see is the bulk of your points come in the middle, and come in big chunks at that. The fringes won't change the game. So losing a few tiles at the tail end won't impact the game in a significant way.

Again, the false foundation the OP and you have built your argument on is that each tile is equally weighted. And therefore there is some imbalance in the game if you do not get an equal amount of tiles. The whole point of my argument is that tiles are not equally balanced. Some will be infinitely more valuable than others. It is not how many that you draw but when you draw certain ones that is most important to correlating it to an actual score. Therefore, the minor imbalance in tile drawing will have little to no effect on the ability to generate points and compete in this game.

The game is not broken and I wold say allowing the start player to claim a feature on the starting tile does more harm than good.

However, we are in a Carcassonne forum. I for one, took Brian's comment in context and understood he meant a one turn difference.

In my games, the last tile nearly never a) completes a city, or b) connects features to give the last player a majority. Those are the only times a last tile can make a difference of more than one point. In the case of adding to a road or monastery, the end game scoring for incomplete features is 1 point per tile: the same as completing the feature. If a city is added to without completion, we once again have only a one point game. Games are rarely determined by one point.

If a game would be so close that the last play changed the outcome, we would probably celebrate a great game and play again!

If you really want to make it even, then withdrawal several tiles blindly so that you have a multiple of the number of players plus the starting tile. Now, have each person draw a tile and discard it without looking. What you have is a game with the same number of rounds for each person. You have also removed the possibility that someone is tile counting, which can give veteran players an advantage.

What about farmers? There are lots of times I've seen a small farm (with 1 or 2, or even 3 cities) claimed on the last turn, netting the player 3, 6 or 9 points, which can certainly make the difference.

Having said that, I tend to agree that the advantage the extra tile gives the first player isn't really worth worrying about, especially if you randomly choose the first player anyway!

But you can't say it isn't an advantage. Even with the builder in play, the first player will on average have more turns than the last player, and that could make the difference between winning and losing. I just think that the randomness of the tiles far outweighs that advantage.

You can adjust some rules (f.e. a small city is worth only 2 points instead of 4 - I always play this variant, it's more balanced IMO). If you want to check how the game is played with an even number of tiles, add the King & Scout expansion. At the end take away the longest city/road bonus for each player.

Being a mathematician myself, I can see the idea behind PenumbraPenguin's post. He doesn't state that one additional turn makes a huge difference. He just says that it is not right to say, that [any] number of turns has no bearing [exactly zero impact] on ability to win at all. The statements in square brackets can be implied if the context of the discussion is omitted. The much exaggerated (and, as it was shown, an impossible) scenario simply demonstrates his point.

Of course, the natural language isn't completely precise, but sometimes you cannot help noticing such omissions. And ColtsFan76's statement has two. It should read:

One turn difference has little bearing on ability to win.

No, my statement is my statement. I do not see a correlation on number of turns affecting the win. I stand by that. But we are only talking one to a handful in difference of turns, not some exaggerated imbalance of turns that is impossible to obtain within the parameters of the game.

So if you want to put words in my mouth: Difference in number of turns has little bearing on scoring. But if there is a correlation between number of turns and winning, I don't see it. And no one has proven to me that it exists. In addition to that, I have seen many games where players have taken the exact number of turns and one get clobbered.

Instead, the OP is making an assertion the game is broken and needs fixing. You are over weighting the possibility of a single tile or two at the end of the game to have an impact on the outcome of the game. You are oversimplifying the value of each tile in each situation.

Respuesta 23:
I do not agree that the game is broken. The advantage gained from an extra turn is probably very small, smaller than other factors including the random tile draw, and so certainly it will not always decide the game.

Over a large number of games? A couple of points from your last tile (which are really very easy to get if you have a spare meeple at that point) should change the outcome of a non-negligible proportion of games.

I don't think that the game is broken, and the first player clearly doesn't always win. I also haven't observed a correlation between going first and winning. That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, and I think that it likely does. I also think that it's small and not worth worrying about.

If I'm both teaching the game and going first I'll probably exclude a random (known) tile or two, as I'd feel bad teaching someone a game and taking one more turn than them for no good reason.

Respuesta 24:
An interesting note on the issue: the official PC version of Carcassonne includes an "equal number of turns" option, where a tile or tiles (depending on the number of players) is chosen at random, revealed to all the players, and then removed from the game.



Tema 286: Z-Man edition rules?

Hi all,

Does anyone know what edition of the rules the new 2012 Z-Man edition of Carcassonne comes with? From what I've heard the 3rd(?) work best with some of the expansions?

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
I don't have it, but I'd be astounded if it was anything other than the most recent version (3rd ed).

That's been the only version available for years (it's the version I got 3 years ago), and I can't imagine Z-Man deciding to revert to an earlier version.

But in any case, the differences between all versions are very minor and easily house-ruled; there was a different way of scoring farms in earlier versions; and also an exception to the normal city scoring rules for two-tile cities, which has been done away with as it needlessly complicated things.

So even if you did end up with an older version of the rules, it would be very simple to obtain the "correct" ones and use them instead.

When playing the Abbey tile to finish a city where you have a builder, do you still get to pull a second tile?

There's a Princess tile that has 2 city sections. One section is a corner piece of city with a shield on it. The other is one side city shaped like a "V" and has a princess on it. If the corner section is played on an existing city (the city with the shield on it, not the princess mark), can the princess mark on the tile still steal the city? Someone played that to steal my large city last night and said the princess "tile" works for stealing a city even if the piece of thand he (the princess) is on doesn't actually add to the city.

You cannot turn the river back upon itself if no other tile first is placed between the two river turns.
Someone can call me a liar, but I just hit this rule on the Carcassonne App the other day and it implements this as follows:

If the river is turned via two 90 elbow placements a total of 180 degrees, either clockwise or counter clockwise, the next 90 turn must be played on the river in the OPPOSITE direction.

This is regardless of how straights or forks have been played since the previous corner was added, or in between the two corners.

Respuesta 4:
Example: You played a straight river tile (say your at the table looking at the tiles, and it's coming straight down towards you). The next player plays a 90 bend/curve river, places it point to your right. The next tile cannot be placed so the river goes back up. There must be at least one straight river between before playing the curve back up. Check out: http://www.modernjive.com/carcassonne/carcassonnetheriver.ht... for pics. I had bought my River I & II and found this to be helpful. Hope that helps.

Respuesta 5:
The rule is in place because if you turn the river upon itself, there are not enough river tiles that have matching features to be able to complete the river. You are pulling from a subset of only 12 tiles (if using only one river expansion).

This is not meant to offend by stating the obvious, it's just to show that what you are trying to achieve is to finish the river before playing the normal tiles, the rules are there just to help you achieve that. There need not be rules about laying them, you just need to think: "right, how should I place this river section tile that I have just drawn, so that we can get to the last river tile and play a really cool game of Carcassonne"

If so, the river is not allowed to turn in that direction.

So the "unfinished river" example in the link would not be allowed, as the 3rd turn bends the river in such a way that continuing the river on in that direction would make a new river tile adjacent to the spring.

I'm the same when it comes to the "unfinished river" as we like to play when it is completed. We put the volcano and the other end of river tile (the one that looks like it runs or crashes into the castle wll) aside. When the River T in drawn, then we mix in the end river piece and hold on to the volcano until it is the last piece to place.

Carc is a 2 dimensional game with an overhead perspective. The simplest interpretation of the rule is no two left or right turns consecutively, regardless of the intervening tiles, is allowed. This accomplishes the idea that the River is used to break up large farms that may be created early in the game and easily dominated by a single player, scoring gobs of points at game end.

That was the reason for The river, was it not?

Tema 292: The Flier with Castles
Pregunta:
We had an interesting rules question that came up last night playing Bridges, Castles, and Bazaars combined with The Flier.

A fairly large-scoring city was close to completion, so Red placed a semi-circle nearby with her follower on it, hoping to double up points with a castle.

Next turn, Blue then drew a flier tile and landed his follower in that same semi-circle with Red.

Later, Red created a small city with both her and Blue still in it... Could either decide to build the castle? And if so, did it prevent the other from scoring the quick 4 points?

We decided yes on both accounts (and gave the option to build the castle by turn order, starting with active player), but wondered what others thought of this!

Respuesta 1:
Here's how I would parse it.

Conversion to a castle may be elected by the occupier on a "town" in lieu of scoring.

1. In the case of a single occupier: Well, the rules are written for a single occupier. Follow the normal rules

2. In the case of multiple occupiers where only one player holds the majority: Use the rules as if the player-in-majority were the only occupier.

3. In the case of multiple occupiers with a shared majority: Each player-in-majority would have the opportunity to decide if they wanted to convert the town into a castle in lieu of scoring the town. And they could each make a different decision:

Decide to forego scoring in favor of placing a castle: the player-in-majority expends a castle. They score no points, and the castle is placed with their follower in it.

Decide to score the town: the player-in-majority would score the completed town, receive the appropriate points, and the follower would be removed.

This is done for each player-in majority. Thus, you may have "multiple" castles on a single town if both decided to place a castle. For ease of record keeping (since both castles would score at the same time) discard additional castles placed or stack them one on top of the other and place all followers in the castles on top of the stack.

If the first player decided to place a castle, the second would also need to place a castle of their own to gain the benefit and could not use the first player's choice for a free castle, but could avoid it by simply choosing to score the town instead.

If you want to get the benefit of the castle, even if another player is castling, you must also expend a castle or you only get the points for the town. If you want to avoid the castle, you only need not expend one.

This has the effect of ensuring that, in order to benefit from a limited resource—Castles—a player must expend the resource.



Tema 293: cathedral
Pregunta:
A incomplete city with cathedral on it scores zero at game end. What about the situation we had in a game where I had a follower on a partial city and my opponent played cathedral on a city nearby. The only way I could complete my city was to become attached to the partial cathedral containing city. At game end does my partial city score zero (even though it had no cathedral on it) because the only way I could have completed it was to attach to cathedral tile? This was the reasoning my opponent used.

Respuesta 1:
Not entirely sure what you mean...

If your city becomes part of the other city, they are no-longer separate and become one city which is affected by the cathedral and scores half points if complete and none if not. If they share a tile, but do not share walls, they remain separate and your city is unaffected by the cathedral.

Susie_Cat.

Respuesta 2:
If your incomplete city is not connected to the other city with the cathedral in it, then you would score the points as normal. Your city does not have a cathedral in it so the rules of the cathedral do not apply.

With later expansions there are many tiles that allow you to create separate cities, like the one in the base set with two capping pieces. I believe your opponent was arguing that the two partial cities would have to be connected in order to complete them which does not have to be true.

Respuesta 3:
A city includes all of the city tiles that are surrounded by walls. If you placed a tile to connect your city to one with a cathedral, those two smaller cities are now one larger city. If the city is completed this way (or later) whoever has the most followers in the city scores 3x points. If the city is not completed and stays that way until the end of the game, no one with followers in the city will score any points.

Respuesta 4:
There is no such things as "must be connected to be completed". There are no tiles left, so the only way to connect them would be with imaginary tiles. I choose the imaginary tile that splits the cities in 2.

As the rules are written, that type of argument is called "being a sore loser".

(also as noted above, there are all kinds of tiles provided in various expansions that would easily split your city in 2).

Respuesta 5:
Your opponent was really reading into the rules. His or her logic was a real stretch. Nowhere in the rules is there a reference to "a city that could only be completed by connecting to another existing city".

Respuesta 6:
Amazing.

The answer to this is completely clear in the rules, as shown by everyone here agreeing. Your opponent is talking nonsense and you simply shouldn't let them away with it.

Quote:
=The Rules]If one or both Cathedral tiles are located in a completed city, the knight earns 3 points per city segment (number of tiles) and pennant. If such a city is not completed by the end of the game, the knight scores 0 points for the player!
I think "located in" is pretty unambiguous. Was the cathedral located in your city? No. So this rule doesn't apply. Never mind what might or might not have been hypothetically possible; the rules have nothing to do with "woulda coulda shoulda" situations. You can argue almost anything if you start getting hypothetical.



Tema 294: knights
Pregunta:
Is it possible to have more than 2 knights on a completed city?

Respuesta 1:
Yes.

More than one follower (knight or otherwise) can end up on a completed feature (city, road, or farm) when two separate features, with followers legally placed on them, become joined by a tile. The followers can be owned by different players, or by the same player, or some combo.

The rules do a good job of illustrating this, actually.

This is correct. It may be beyond the scope of what you're looking for, but The Count expansion also allows adding Knights to a completed city.

Respuesta 3:
In fact, if you play with someone as devious and cutthroat as my nephew, you could end up with 3 or four knights in a city by carefully crafty tile placement.

This happens when two knights in "independent" city pieces are somehow joined by the placement of a tile. This particular strategy is most developed with the use of the   expansion since the Mayor's value "improves" depending on the number of pennants in the city.

Thanks guys



Tema 295: Two questions on castle placement
Pregunta:
So my friends and I ran into a couple of situations when using the bridges, castles, and bazaars expansion last week and have been unable to find an official solution to these questions.

[Question 1]

Here is the start of my turn:

I place the tile I have drawn and decide to convert the city to a castle instead of scoring it:

Then I place a follower on the unoccupied city like so:


I argue that the castle conversion does not count as placing a follower because he was already there to begin with, therefore, placing a follower on the other city is legal. My friends, however, argue that when the castle was placed I had removed the original follower and then had to place a new follower on the castle to claim it, so I would be unable to claim the other city due to the fact that I already placed a follower this turn. How do you in the community resolve this situation?

[Question 2]

Here is the setup at the start of my friends turn(this situation has been simplified, there were other tiles adjacent to mine making it a legal placement):

She draws and plays:

I choose to play a castle instead of scoring the small city I'm on:


I argue that I can decide to play this castle and then due to the fact that her city scores this turn that I receive the points for it as well. My friend argues that I cannot castle my small city due to the fact that is not my turn, so I would only receive the 4 points for the completed small city. Again I'm curious to see what the community here has to say about this.

Respuesta 1:
Question 1: You are correct. Converting a castle is not considered placing a follower - and the follower on there was never "removed" or scored.

Question 2: You'd receive points only when the first structure (cloister, city or road) in its vicinity is completed during a subsequent turn. This means you score nothing this turn (because you chose to convert instead of scoring this turn), but keep your follower on the castle.

Also, you can convert a castle on any player's turn, but if you convert, you don't get the 4 points for the small city.



Tema 296: How long is a reasonable time to place a tile and meeple/follower?
Pregunta:
Since the various expansions seem to add length to the game, what is considered a reasonable amount of time to place your tile and follower?

I'm as guilty as anyone of taking "forever" to place my tiles .

It seems to take too long with more than one expansion unless there is some kind of time limit.

Respuesta 1:
15-20 seconds seems reasonable. You can speed it up by having people place and then draw (so they can think about where they might place their tile while others are playing).

Respuesta 2:
Chris Ferejohn
@cferejohn

I would strongly caution against this. It won't be an issue for every expansion but in some case by drawing in advance the player's "knowledge of the future" can cause issues. For example:

Red has all of his meeples committed to tiles. after finishing his turn he draws a cloister tile from the bag that will fit perfectly into a hole in the board and score an "instant" nine points. Red is bummed he can't get said points. However, Blue is next and she draws a tile that activates the dragon. The dragon is near a red meeple that probably won't end up scoring more than 9 points. Therefore, when it is red's turn to move the dragon instead of moving it defensively he encourages the dragon to remove his own piece by moving it closer to said meeple. That way when his turn comes around again he can grab that easy 9 points from the cloister using the "eaten" meeple. Had he not know what his tile was going to be he probably would have moved the dragon differently and then not been able to claim the cloister.

I picked a not so obvious example to illustrate the problems with this method of tile drawing but it more clearly breaks down with mechanics like the builder and the marketplace to name a few.

I disagree with this sentiment. There isn't a big enough impact to the game in a negative way but benefits the speed of the game tremendously. Draw a new tile as soon as you are done placing the one you have.

Only two situations have presented a "problem" and need to be agreed upon/reminded.
1) Playing with the Abby so you either effectively have a tile for two turns in a row if you decide you want to play the Abby instead, or force the player to choose if he will place the Abby on the next turn before drawing a new tile.

2) At the end of the game with the Builder in play, there might not be enough tiles in play so as the game winds down to the final round or two, people shouldn't grab a tile until the start of their turn in case things run out earlier than expected.

Respuesta 8:
I agree with Brian. We always use the rule that you can draw your next tile at the end of your turn.

I can see the point that in some cases (like the aforementioned example with the dragon) it will alter how the game plays out. But I don't see that this is a problem; it's different, but not (IMO) worse. After all, it's the same for everyone.

Respuesta 9:
To answer the OP, I think about 45 seconds maximum is reasonable.

I know that sounds like a lot, but in base Carcassonne with 72 tiles, if every turn took 45 seconds the game would be 54 minutes long. With both Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders, it would be 85 minutes.

That's a bit longer than ideal, but of course that's a maximum time. Some turns the choice will be obvious, so in fact the game would be much shorter than that. But really, how long is reasonable is however long the group feels is reasonable! We've never imposed a maximum, we just start nagging if someone takes too long!

It is mid game and everyone has a tile. Green adds a tile to the city her builder is in. She therefore gets to play a second tile immediately. At this point a compromise has to happen. To follow the rules of the game everyone holding a tile would have to put it back in the tile bag, those tiles should be in the pool that green gets to draw her second tile from. Grey had the perfect tile and is very upset that he has "loose it" and feels screwed. The other option is green draws from the bag that does not have the other players drawn tiles in it (they don't put their tiles back in the bag). Green is very good at Carcassonne and knows that the tile she is looking for is still not played. That is why she added to her city with builder; to get a second chance at drawing the tile she needs. Unfortunately, red has said tile and green is wasting her time/turn and would have played differently had she known the tile was not available. She got screwed.

You over dramatize this. There is no guarantee that the builder would have taken the tile that someone else is holding. Your example can still happen even without players taking a tile right away and so offers no substance to the debate.

The impact to the game is minimal and offset in the fact that everyone is at the same (dis)advantage. A player could lose their "prefect piece" before it gets to their turn anyway - or new "best play" options come up with the play of any tile.

Carcassonne is not a "perfect information" game at all. You don't know what tile will be drawn at any given time. A perfect info game would have all the tiles face-up.

Play how you want but the game benefits from having a tile in hand at all times.

OK, I see what you're saying (but please put some empty lines in your wall of text next time!), but I don't think it makes any real difference. Let me explain.

In your example, Red has the tile Green wants. But there's no way for Green to know that. In this situation, Green should either hope the tile is available and go for it, or choose not to take that risk.

And you have no control over what tile you draw, so it's not like Red could choose to block Green in this manner. It's just the luck of the draw -- which is the same luck that applies every time you draw a tile. So in a very real sense, Green's reliant on the luck of the draw whichever rule you use.

In reality, most people don't gamble on getting the tile they want in this manner, because even if it is available your chance of getting it is low -- unless it's one of the last few tiles, in which case this does alter things slightly.

But if that matters to you, you can rule that for the last go (or couple of goes) round the table everyone only draws at the start of their turn as per the written rules. (As in fact is typically done toward the end of the game with the Builder in play, even by groups who use the "draw-ahead" rule.)

Also, most times it's worth getting the extra turn with the Builder anyway, unless the tile you have is better somewhere else. Whatever you draw can usually be used somewhere, if you're playing properly.

You are correct, it is possible green would not draw the necessary tile but there is a chance, a probability that she factored in when she choose to add to her city that contained a builder. If red has the tile she needs there is no chance she can draw it. Thus the game is fundamentally changed.

Carcassone is totally a perfect information game. All drawn tiles are face up in the center of the table (if playing correctly). Therefore, the content of the tile bag can be determined and from there the probability of drawing the needed tile can be calculated and factored into all decisions. If you are not playing this way you are not playing to win.

The easiest example of this is in the base set. The base set has two cloister tiles with 1 road leading to them. This tile is the easiest way to join two separate farms. I, and the people I play with, carefully keep track of how many of said tiles are left in the bag. Knowing that at least one is left in the bag very much changes how I play my fields. I will grab a small field if I know I still have a 50/50 chance (in a two player game) of grabbing the tile I need to connect it to a larger field. I would therefore add to my city that has a builder in it in order to get a second chance at drawing one of the two cloisters this turn. If the other player has it though I am wasting my time. It is a different game at that point.

But you are very much changing the probabilities. If red has the tile then the probability of green getting it are zero. If the tile is in the bag the probability is x/y; where x is number of tiles that would fit and y is the number of tiles left in the bag.

No, I don't think you understand the definition of "prefect information." A PI game can be played 100% the same way each time you play (take for example  ). That is not possible when a a game has random information that is hidden (draw piles). You can determine what is in the bag and the odds but that does not mean you will draw the tile you want. Therefore you do not know what you are getting and you do not have all the information therefore not a perfect information game.

Completely disagree. Whether the tile you are looking for is still in the bag or in someone's hand you have the same chance of drawing it. And if it is in the bag and not the one you grab and someone else does, you will know soon enough that it is now "out of play."

It can't change the way you play unless people draw their tile and keep it face up in front of them before it is played.

You are not changing tactics because people are sitting on a tile a round early.

I have played both ways many times and I prefer the draw as soon as you play option as it does not change the dynamics of the game and speeds it up tremendously.

The probability to draw the tile is the same regardless of if red drew a tile on her turn or before it. The fact that red is holding 1 tile should make no difference in probability calculations because green has no clue what red is holding. When green sees 40 tiles in a bag and 1 in hand, green knows he has 1 in 41 chance of drawing the tile he needs. If green sees 41 tiles in a bag he still knows he has 1 in 41 chance of drawing the tile he needs.

I'd be prefectly happy to play carcassone with stacks of tiles, one for each player. I typically do this in 6-player games and we'll split stacks if someone runs out of tiles (due to the builder).

Carcassone is totally a perfect information game. All drawn tiles are face up in the center of the table (if playing correctly). Therefore, the content of the tile bag can be determined and from there the probability of drawing the needed tile can be calculated and factored into all decisions. If you are not playing this way you are not playing to win.
No, I don't think you understand the definition of "prefect information." A PI game can be played 100% the same way each time you play (take for example  ). That is not possible when a a game has random information that is hidden (draw piles). You can determine what is in the bag and the odds but that does not mean you will draw the tile you want. Therefore you do not know what you are getting and you do not have all the information therefore not a perfect information game.
Ok, I concede that I may be using the wrong term. Let me rephrase it Carcassone is a game of probability and optimization with no secret information.

Quote:
Completely disagree. Whether the tile you are looking for is still in the bag or in someone's hand you have the same chance of drawing it.
If someone else has it the probability is zero, if it is still in the bag the probability is greater than zero, and therefore still has a chance of happening. Those are two very different probabilities.

And if it is in the bag and not the one you grab and someone else does, you will know soon enough that it is now "out of play."
But you wont know it on your turn, and knowing it is still available or if it is already take can and often does how I will play my tile this turn.

Quote:
It can't change the way you play unless people draw their tile and keep it face up in front of them before it is played.
Playing like this changes the game even more. Now it is a game of probability and optimization while factoring in what your opponent(s) can and cant do on their next turn.

You over dramatize this. There is no guarantee that the builder would have taken the tile that someone else is holding. Your example can still happen even without players taking a tile right away and so offers no substance to the debate.

The impact to the game is minimal and offset in the fact that everyone is at the same (dis)advantage. A player could lose their "prefect piece" before it gets to their turn anyway - or new "best play" options come up with the play of any tile.

Carcassonne is not a "perfect information" game at all. You don't know what tile will be drawn at any given time. A perfect info game would have all the tiles face-up.

Play how you want but the game benefits from having a tile in hand at all times.
You are correct, it is possible green would not draw the necessary tile but there is a chance, a probability that she factored in when she choose to add to her city that contained a builder. If red has the tile she needs there is no chance she can draw it. Thus the game is fundamentally changed.

Carcassone is totally a perfect information game. All drawn tiles are face up in the center of the table (if playing correctly). Therefore, the content of the tile bag can be determined and from there the probability of drawing the needed tile can be calculated and factored into all decisions. If you are not playing this way you are not playing to win.

The easiest example of this is in the base set. The base set has two cloister tiles with 1 road leading to them. This tile is the easiest way to join two separate farms. I, and the people I play with, carefully keep track of how many of said tiles are left in the bag. Knowing that at least one is left in the bag very much changes how I play me fields. I will for sure grab a small filed if I know I still have a 50/50 chance (in a two player game) of grabbing the tile I need to connect it to a larger field. I would therefore add to my city that has a builder in it in order to get a second chance at drawing one of the two cloisters this turn. If the other player has it though I am wasting my time. It is a different game at that point.
The probability to draw the tile is the same regardless of if red drew a tile on her turn or before it. The fact that red is holding 1 tile should make no difference in probability calculations because green has no clue what red is holding. When green sees 40 tiles in a bag and 1 in hand, green knows he has 1 in 41 chance of drawing the tile he needs. If green sees 41 tiles in a bag he still knows he has 1 in 41 chance of drawing the tile he needs.
You are mixing apples and oranges. In pure Caracassone the player perceived probability and the actual probability are the same (this is what I was trying to get at earlier when i called it a perfect information game). By drawing tiles early the two become different. There is the actual probability of what is in the bag and then there is the probability that green can factor not knowing what other people have. These are two (possibly very) different probabilities. You have changed the game.

In your example, Red has the tile Green wants. But there's no way for Green to know that. In this situation, Green should either hope the tile is available and go for it, or choose not to take that risk.

And you have no control over what tile you draw, so it's not like Red could choose to block Green in this manner. It's just the luck of the draw -- which is the same luck that applies every time you draw a tile. So in a very real sense, Green's reliant on the luck of the draw whichever rule you use.
But you are very much changing the probabilities. If red has the tile then the probability of green getting it are zero. If the tile is in the bag the probability is x/y; where x is number of tiles that would fit and y is the number of tiles left in the bag.
If there are 50 tiles left that Green has not seen, then there is a 1 in 50 chance that Green might draw a specific tile. Green has no way of knowing which of those might be in other players' hands, and the chance that any other given player has already drawn it is 1 in 50 -- exactly the same as the chance that Green will draw it now.

So in a Schrodinger's Cat, uncollapsed waveform kind of way, Green's chance of drawing the tile is unaffected by the fact that the other players have already drawn! There are 50 tiles out there, and the chance that Green will draw any given one is the same, from Green's POV.

In reality, most people don't gamble on getting the tile they want in this manner, because even if it is available your chance of getting it is low -- unless it's one of the last few tiles, in which case this does alter things slightly.
If you are not playing the probabilities and keeping track of at least key tiles you are not playing to win IMO. The base game comes with a sheet to consult during the games in order to see what tile are left to be drawn.
Yes, I know that. What I'm saying is that looking for one specific tile among 50 (or 20 for that matter) is not a sensible gamble. You should be hoping for a good tile, not risking everything on the tiny chance of getting the perfect one.

(As an aside, I actually don't usually keep precise track of the tiles, though I will often check late in the game to see if the tile I want is still available. The expansions don't come with sheets depicting all the tiles, though I have printed out sheets from the CAR to use in the game.)

No the point is whether you don't have it because it is still in the bag or because someone has it in hand, YOU still don't have it. And whether you don't have it on your first play or the 2nd tile because of the builder, you STILL don't have it. You won't find out if you still don't have it on your next turn. But if I play it on my turn, now you actually found out earlier.

No. It only changes the probability if you know where everything is at. Again, if there are 40 tiles left and you need only 1 of them, you have a 1 in 40 chance whether that is in the bag or in someone's hand. You not knowing where that tile resides does not change the probabilities therefore can't have an impact on tactics.

But it's not......

Respuesta 24:
Here is another way to look at your probabilities and why what you say can't be used to employ a claim the game is so dramatically changed.

You claim you use a draw bag (I think, since I have used that terminology in reply to you). The bag is not part of the base game and therefore a "variant" introduced in later expansions. We use the method that we randomly stack up piles of tiles around the table so everyone can get to them easily, which is the "correct" way to play:

Quote:
Shuffle the remaining land tiles face down and stack them in several face-down stacks so that all players have easy access to them.
So if the perfect tile is not in the pile closest to me, I have zero chance of drawing it if I stick with the closest pile. No matter what I do, unless I change piles or shuffle them up mid-game, I am never going to draw that tile.

But I would have to know which piles contain which tiles to properly do the probabilities. Or I would first have to calculate the probability that the tile I want is in the pile I draw from and then calculate the probability that I draw it from the pile if it is there.

This is no different than claiming you have 1+X draw piles where X is the number of players and their piles are a tile of one (in their hand).

If you play with multiple piles, you are playing the original game and therefore subject to the same probabilities we are describing for players who draw early. And that is actually closer to the "real game" not the variant that you have introduced....



Tema 297: Contiguity of fields when using bridge and river tiles
Pregunta:
In the top left tile in the picture at

http://www.boardgames.ca/productimages06b/carcassonne_river2...

Is there one field, or two? Depending on how that bridge were built in the real world, the field to the "north" of the bridge could run under the bridge and therefore be connected to the field to the "south" of the bridge. Is this how things work in the Carcassonne game world, or would the two fields always be considered to be separate?

Actually, in the top left tile, there are four fields. The river divides it left and right and the road divides it top and bottom.

A road splits everything regardless of the art. In other words, the bridge doesn't allow the fields to sneak by. Only when an expansion tells you the art specifically doesn't split it, does it not split it. I am thinking of those roads that dive underground as tunnels. In this case, the same field then runs around the road.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks, Brian!

Yes, of course there are four fields

Going by the rest of your answer, the tile that's fourth from the left and third from the top in

http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/carc...

Has two separate fields, one to the left of the river and one to the right. Is that correct? My point, of course, is that in this case the art seems to suggest that the field continues directly under the bridge, in the sense that someone of an appropriate size could walk from the top left corner of the tile, under the bridge, to the bottom left corner of the tile.

Or perhaps there's a troll under the bridge that I haven't seen?!

Respuesta 3:
After a long serpentine answer trying to jog my memory, I found this:

 

The bridge cuts the fields. So on the tile in reference, there are again 4 separate fields. However, in the placement you linked to, two of these quadrants have been reconnected through other tiles making it only three distinct farms.

EDIT: And actually, following the links within that link, the relevant post is here from Matt Harper:

Respuesta 4:
A farm is a contiguous green area. A tile with a bridge makes the two green areas non-contiguous. Hence, the bridges act as a farm boundary.

The wooden bridges added in the C&B&B expansion do not break up the farm due to their third dimensional nature.

I didn't notice this before. The iPad app does indeed consider the field going under the city bridge (not road bridge) contiguous. Odd.

Until perhaps you get to certain expansions, there should NEVER be any multiplying or dividing with the scores between players. Just addition or subtraction.

Either 1 person gets 'X' # of points, or all players tied for the most of something get 'X' # of points each.

Ok, what if I have Farmer A on one set of farms and Farmer B on another set that is not connected at all. By the end of the game both Famer A and B are connected to all 11 finished Cities. No other player has any other Farmers on these farms. Do I get 33 points for Farms or 66?

I am guessing that it is the same as if I had 2 different Meeples of mine on 2 different City tiles and they end up connected. I only get to score them once regardless of how many of my Meeples end up on the completed city?

Respuesta 5:

Respuesta 6:
No -- 66 points is correct. In the current version of the rules, which are now synced between Rio Grande and the HiG version, you may score the same city from multiple farms.

I understood from his post that the 2 farms wound up being connected, in which case 33 pts. If they were separate farms connected to the same cities then 66 pts.

Respuesta 8:
Here's what my copy of the rules say (from the Big Box #3 set, p. 5):

Quote:
* For each completed city the farm supplies, the player who deployed the most farmer(s) in the farm earns 3 points, regardless of the size of the city. If players tie with the most farmers, each scores 3 points.

* A farm can score several cities if they border the farm.

* Several farms can supply a single city. In such a case, each farm is scored separately, as described above.
In one of the examples shown, red has two farmers and yellow has one on the same field which is adjacent to two completed cities. Red scores 3, which is three points per city.

Another example shows blue having two farmers on either side of a city, but their fields are disconnected. In this case each farmer scores three points for the same city.

Respuesta 9:
Trevin is wright. If the farms are disconnected a City can score not just one time, but for different not connected farms (German HiG rules)

Respuesta 10:

@laphilfan
I understood from his post that the 2 farms wound up being connected, in which case 33 pts. If they were separate farms connected to the same cities then 66 pts.
This is correct. If there is a single farm that has two farmers, you only get 3*#cities. If there are two separate farms that each have a single farmer and both somehow touch all the same cities, you'd get 2*3*#cities.

If you control two huge farms that both touch all 11 finished cities (unlikely, but possible), you have 66 potential points. If the two farms happen to become connected, and therefore merge, you now only have 33 potential points.

As worded, the question was ambiguous, hence the different responses.

Tema 302: Questiong about T-junction/Crossing.
Pregunta:
Hey guys,

I played Carcassonne for the first time tonight but we were confused about this certain tile.

Here is the Tile we were having issue with.

http://imgur.com/bFPEH

Assuming the other end of the road has ended, the opposite end of the road hits the above tile, would the road be closed and thus ended or could it continue going.

I said it looked like that tile would end the road and it would be scored at the time. But a friend said it could pass though east and west thus being longer and scoring him more points.

If don't want to see the picture there is a city to the north. With a T section of three roads meeting east, west, and south, with some bushes in the center of the crossing roads. My friend suggested it looked like the road kinda passed though the bush or under it going east to west.

Lastly, do both of these two tiles end and or close a road.

In case your friend wants some official evidence, this is in the rules, though admittedly it could be better explained:

In the second picture you linked to, from the beginning of the rules, the places where the roads connect are clearly labelled as "crossings". Under "A Completed Road" (bottom of page 2 on the official PDF) it says "A road is complete when the road segments on both ends connect to a crossing".

That should prevent any arguments, I hope!



Tema 303: City Walls -- Do They Have to Touch Perfectly?
Pregunta:
New to the game . . . played with some friends last night and we had a few situations with cities that we weren't sure about.

Simply put, do city walls have to touch perfectly with every segment?

The city segment we were trying to play off had two walls. The segment we wanted to place down matched only one of the walls. The new segment actually only had one city wall on it.

Would that be a legal play?

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
I'm not quite sure what situation you describe, but city walls do not have to match perfectly. City walls have to join up to 'surround' the city, and at this point the city is said to be 'completed'.

Edit: All of the following are legal plays:


As Andy mentions above, it is the edges of each tile that must match with any adjoining tiles. City matches city, road matches road, field matches field.

In this example, all tiles are legal, except that marked 'A' as the a city segment adjoins a road along one of it's edges:


Even if the tile marked 'A' was rotated, this would still be illegal as now the field segment adjoins a road along one of it's edges:

Yeah, I wasn't sure how perfect the city pieces had to fit. At first thought you couldn't play a city piece unless the walls fit absolutely perfectly with the other pieces, but then realized growing cities would be just about impossible

Thanks again

Respuesta 4:
The answer to the original question is YES, they have to match perfectly. The tile placement described would be illegal.

I believe this example shows a situation most like what the original post described:



The important thing to remember when laying any tile, is that every edge has to match the type of edge that it touches. All sides, every feature type, every time. Open sides/edges are of course just that - still open.

Sure, sometimes it means you have to wait for a very specific tile to be drawn, sometimes you never draw it and that giant city you have been waiting an hour to complete doesn't get completed. That is Carcassonne.

Respuesta 5:
I think it'd be a good idea to stop using the word 'walls' because you'll only confuse yourself, especially with respect to other-Carc-games that actually have an element called 'city walls'.

As stated above, where any two tile edges touch they must match (and if you wish to make a placement that creates one or more new edge-touches you must make sure all edge-matches are legal or you cannot make that placement). City edge to city edge, road edge to road edge, field edge to field edge. The 'walls' around city segments defining boundaries between city and field (or more rarely, city and something else) are not relevant to legal tile placement.

Respuesta 6:
We are newbies apparently with a newer edition of the game where *lots* of tiles don’t align on the edges, but this kind of stuff was driving us crazy. Walls leading into dirt just seemed plain wrong. Would everybody here accept these placements? It sounds like the recommendation is just that the edge type has to match all other touching edges?

Respuesta 7:
It's not an issue with a specific version, but a specific individual game where the tile punchboards have been printed or punched with a slight offset.

All punchboards have some variation in them in every game that uses them, i.e. very often.

If it is really bad, ask the importer/publisher.

Correct, only the features have to match on all sides and expect to accept some variation in the actual graphics alignment.

We are newbies apparently with a newer edition of the game where *lots* of tiles don’t align on the edges, but this kind of stuff was driving us crazy. Walls leading into dirt just seemed plain wrong. Would everybody here accept these placements? It sounds like the recommendation is just that the edge type has to match all other touching edges?
Yes, these tiles are placed correctly.

The edition doesn't matter. In the base game each tile can only have three different edges: city, field, road and since the tiles are square they will have a combination of four of these. Roads will always go to the center of the side. Tiles that have a combination of cities and fields and/or roads will have "city walls" that separate the city part of the tile from the other parts. These walls will always end up in a corner of the tile.

So you only care about the edge alignments. That "walls leading into dirt" seems wrong is just because you haven't placed the two tiles above your current for tiles in your picture.

Look at page 19 in the annotated Carcassonne rules (linked in a post above in this thread).

With some new expansions you get a feature (streams/rivers), but it adheres to the same rules as roads, that is that it always connect in the middle of an edge.

Also, perfect graphical alignment is impossible for a game as Carcassonne even if the tiles are cut perfectly since the tiles have to be designed to work in any combination. That means that tiles that connect "city walls" diagonally will have a small space in between them since the other two tiles won't have these walls.

I don't know if it's the way your camera has taken this photo, but the quality of those tiles looks terrible. Both in terms of the alignment and the "finish".

Where did you buy it from? A popular game like Carcassonne is prone to counterfeiting.

Respuesta 10:
I think part of it's the punching. If you punch quickly without as much care, you can end up with more roughness on the edges. On the other hand, mine didn't need punched and I was quite surprised a version existed that did.

It also looks like a bad matte finish but that could be the flash/camera angle.



Tema 304: Question About Filling Holes
Pregunta:
Just got Carcassonne for Christmas and am learning how to play it. If you have a 1-tile hole, and someone plays a tile in that hole, leaving no more edges to play off of, what happens? Sequence of photos below for clarification:







So would the game now be over, even if there are tiles left? Or is the player not allowed to play a tile that leaves no more moves (i.e. the tile is deemed "unplayable" and is discarded)?

Respuesta 1:
You don't have to play off of the tile that was just played. You can play off of any spot on the board that matches up with the tile that you draw.

Respuesta 2:
According to the pictures you shown, you are playing a bit wrong. Each tile that is drawn has to be played off of another tile, the only tile that can be placed without another tile on the surface is the starting tile. So you can not just decide to start your own area away from the other tiles unless it is linked to it. Good luck playing this awesome game, and feel free to ask more questions.
Billy

Respuesta 3:
Billy, The photo is a bit deceiving. All of the tiles shown are connected to the first tile. But it sounds like we were playing wrong, based on Jason's post.
Jason, you mentioned that you do not have to play off of the previously laid tile... I initially had the opposite impression from the rules, but after re-reading them, I see what you mean. It says: "The new tile must be placed with at least one edge adjacent and abutting one previously placed tile. The new tile may not simply be placed corner to corner with a previous tile." I think that I had previously read it as "the previously placed tile"

Well I suppose that solves our problem... we had been playing by always playing off of the last laid tile. That completely changes the game! I'll remember to read more carefully next time

Thanks to you both!

Not true! You may only ever play on the tile just placed (unless playing with magic portals from Princess & Dragon). If you can't place a follower because everything is already claimed, then you just don't get to place.

In any case, in the example above, I count a field, two roads, and a city that could all be claimed. There is nothing game stopping about this tile placement.

You can join them up, but you can't remove any meeples until the city is completed (at which point you can remove all of them).

Respuesta 2:
Of course you can, this method is useful to prevent others taking over/be part of that city.
You can't take away one of your meeples, it stays there until the city is complete!

Edit: Chris was slightly faster.

Respuesta 3:
You can join them, but imho you may only remove both meeples when the joined city is completed. So there's no joining to get one meeple back.

I would join them if your opponent has the majority on an adjacent field, thus reducing his/her points. If however you have the majority you would reduce your own (field) points by joining.



Tema 306: Farms
Pregunta:
In the original carcassonne rules it says: "For each city a farm supplies, the player who deployed the most farmer(s) in the farm earns 3 points..."
In the Traders and Builders expansion it says "When scoring farmers at the end of the game,, the player earns 5 points instead of 4 points for each city he scores that has a pig in the field with his farmer(s)"

Which one is right? I have the edition of carcassonne that included the River1 expansion. Have the rules been updated?
Please help!!

Respuesta 1:
The rules from Traders & Builders reflect an older edition of Carcassonne; 3 points per city is correct (and therefore, 4 if the pig is involved).

Respuesta 2:
Thank you!

Respuesta 3:
These two scoring systems differ by more than just the number of points per city.

First edition rules involve looking at each complete city, counting the farmers on adjoining farms, and awarding 4 points to someone.

Third edition rules (those which come in current editions of the game) involve looking at each farm, counting the farmers, and awarding 3 points for each complete city bordering that farm to someone. I think these rules also give 4 points for cities consisting of only 2 tiles.

Use whichever matches how you score farms =)

Respuesta 4:
I will ask here to not open a new thread...

When farmer is surrounded with roads and finished cities, does the scoring starts that moment and farmer gets back in the "hand" or farmers stay till the end of the game?

Respuesta 5:
As far as I know, the farmer always stays until the end of the game.

Respuesta 6:
Yep - a farmer is there until the end of the game, unless something rips it away (dragon, tower, etc). The only exception is the Barn from the Abbey and Mayor expansion.

He's right: you count all the tiles with a part of the city. There are 4 tiles, so your score is 8. There are also some situations like this which can arise with roads and you use the same principle there: count the number of tiles, do not count tiles twice for whatever reason.

In our "family friendly" games, we usually won't do this, unless the person would win the game or finish higher than the current player, with the unfinished city points. Since we track our game wins and finishes throughout the year, and maintain charts showing our comparative standings, we do strive to win or finish as high as possible in all our games. If the cathedral wouldn't help or hurt the current player, he probably won't damage another player, just to be nasty. [Note: our games involve at least 5, and usually 6 or 7 players, which makes some difference, too]

Not related to your question, but we don't stack the tiles for drawing. We use a draw bag and pass it around. Less chance of accidentally knocking over a stack and revealing tiles. When the tiles are about to run out, anyone can count them inside the bag, and usually we know when we have two left, each (for 6 or 7 players, that's important).

Tema 309: retrieving and immediately placing meeples
Pregunta:
Rule question:

Do meeples become available immediately once you pick them up off the board after completing a road/city/cloister. In other words, if I finish a cloister I'm occupying by placing another cloister, but all meeples are in play, can I pick that one up, score 9 points and place it on the new cloister right away? I see no restrictions in the rules about this, but I want to be sure.

Respuesta 1:
Unfortunately, you cannot. The order of operations is:

1) Place your tile.
2) Place a meeple on the tile (optional, of course)
3) Score any completed features, removing the meeples on those features.

So if you don't have any meeples available when the tile is placed, you can't place any this turn.

Respuesta 2:
You can only place meeples that you had prior to placing the tile. So you could not score a completed road/city/cloister and then re-use that meeple on the same turn.

EDIT - Beaten to the punch. With more clarity, I might add!

Respuesta 3:
My understanding is that the order of things is...
1) Place a tile
2) Place a meeple (optional)
3) Score completed features

By that order you don't get your meeple back (when you score the feature) until after you are legally allowed to place a meeple. Therefore no, you cannot pick up and then replace a meeple on one turn.

I may be wrong but that is how I've always understood the rule to be. Only meeples already in your supply can be place that turn.

EDIT: Wow!!! I guess I type too slow...2 other responses in the time I answered!

Respuesta 4:
As DoomTurtle pointed out, your turn consists of three steps. placing meeples is step two and removing meeples is step three. If you remove a meepel in step three you can not 'travel backward through time' back to step two and do step two over again.

It's quite hard to miss, actually. Page 1, "Playing the game":

following actions in the order shown:
The player must draw and place a new land tile.
The player may deploy one of his followers from his supply to the land tile he just placed.
If, by placing the land tile, cloisters, roads, and/or cities are completed, they are now scored.
The player’s turn is over and the next player, in clockwise order, takes his turn in the same manner.

Its a good question. Sometimes rules can be so simple you miss the little nuances. Thanks for the reminder to all of us.

Respuesta 12:
To make this rule clear when we're teaching Carcassonne to new players, my GF and I will usually place a meeple on a tile before physically placing it (and encourage others to do the same). In addition to avoiding placing meeples that aren't in one's pool, this also discourages any "oops, wait... I meant to put a meeple on that tile" take-backs that otherwise run rampant (in my experience).



Tema 310: City Segments connected by walls?
Pregunta:
My question is simple enough. How do you know when a City is connected to another? I've played this game several times and I'm still confused about this single rule with cities. I've been trying to figure out who can place their meeples(followers) on which city segments based on the following layout:


**c
**c
**c

**c
**c
**c

where these are 2 pieces that could be connected and 'c' represents a city segment. At first glance it looks like the cities are connected by the wall(not really illustrated by the above). But are they really connected? In other words could someone have placed a meeple on the first piece and then someone else place a meeple on the second piece, only to rejoin them later?

I've been consistent to play every time, declaring that moving meeples on both of these segements is illegal because they appear to be connected by a wall? But someone could later place another segment to close a city off:

**c c**
**c c**
**c c**

None of the above cities are connected. You have to think that every corner is seperated. Only if there is a feature at the middle of orthogonal lying pieces. You should consider them as
***
**c

each. A city tile with 2 corners have

*c*
*cc

you can still place a tile on the upper right corner, (if none are above and to the right) without them being part of the same city.

Tema 311: different rules in main game and tradersnbuilders
Pregunta:
Hello
Can you clarify scoring for farmers please.

My main game says 3 points per city but my traders expansion says 4 points. Both are Rio grande.

When I searched the internet I read there have been 3 editions each with different rules. So I downloaded new instructions from the games website.

It seems wrong too like mine with the pdf says 3 and traders pdf says 4.

Assuming it is the 3 point rule, is it 4 not 5 points for pigs?

Thanks

BTW, main game has copyright 2000 and traders 2003

Respuesta 1:
You may be confusing the two versions of the rules. Most common rules now:

1. Determine who controls the farm (who has the majority of people there).
2. The person/people who control the farm get 3 points for every completed city that borders the farm. 4 per city if a pig is in the farm.

(In the old rules, each city that was supplied by a farm with people in it would give 4 points to the person who had the most farmers supplying it. That may be where you're getting the 4 from.)

Respuesta 2:
Yeah the latest rules are 3 per city, if your new to the game, we find it helpful to count everything but the farms first removing the meeples from the tiles as they are scored then counting the farms, this makes seeing who is where easier due to the fact that there are less meeples on the board.



Tema 312: Changes from First to Third
Pregunta:
So I recently realized that the rules have been updated a bit in the third edition. I've had a look at the pdf over at Rio Grandes homepage, and this is what I found:

1) Completed cities consisting of only 2 tiles now score 4 points, instead of 2.
2) Farms now score 3 points for each adjacent city, instead of 4.
3) Farms also score differently now: Each farm area/field is scored separately from other farms.

Is that it, or did I miss something?


As a side note; I originaly misread the 1ed rules for scoring farms, and have actually been scoring them in the "new" way all the time. I was made aware of this quite some time ago and have been comtemplating switching over to the official version, but always decided not to because "my" version was so much easier to use. Guess that little problem just solved itself

Edit: changed title

Respuesta 1:
Also, the catapult is now mandatory; if you don't own a copy of  , you may substitute   instead.

Other than that, you've covered all of the changes (barring a lot of weird interactions between expansions). Just IMO, I never played with pre-3rd edition rules, and I can't see the appeal of the old farming rules. The small cities, maybe, since they also contribute to massive farms, but I can't see a two-point difference being that big a deal.

Respuesta 2:
3) Farms also score differently now: Each farm area/field is scored separately from other farms.

I am still trying to wrap my head fully around this new scoring. Would you be able to explain the scoring for farms for me?

thanks a lot!

for a city with katharer-tile: *2 for this city


with the barn: normal city 4 points
- with pig-tile (river 2 or miniexpansion from games quarterly): +1

for castle with normal meeple: 4 points
for a castle with the barn: 5 points (6 with pig-tile)

don't forgett the scoring within the game because of placing the barn or wheel of fortune: famine (for every meeple on the farm for every closed city points)

I don't break ties. Ties are suggestive of equally skilled play, which is a fine thing.

Respuesta 11:
I treat it as a draw!

Respuesta 12:
You could try a variant were you keep track of each feature completed by a player every turn and have the person(s) who completed the most number of cities/cloisters/roads score some points at the end of the game the same way trade goods are scored in T&B. For example, you could award 10 points to the guy who finished the most cities and do the same with cloisters and roads.

Respuesta 13:
It's a draw, but if you don't like that then you could hold a hot dog eating contest and the winner of that can be declared the winner of Carcassonne as well.

Respuesta 14:
Fun fact, just had a tie-breaker at BGA and somehow I won. So there must be a tiebreaker but can't find it :-D

Respuesta 15:
I believe I have seen "most meeples not on the board at game end, before scoring" as a tiebreaker, with the logic being that if you scored more points with fewer followers, you played better/more efficiently and would get the win.

I'd certainly think fewer tiles placed should also be on the list, and probably ahead of followers placed.

Tema 315: playing thief and pig on same turn
Pregunta:
Hi need some help can we place a thief and a pig on the same turn? ...player has a farmer in the same field...thank you

Respuesta 1:
No.

Tema 316: Road scoring during the game
Pregunta:
Hi,
I have a question - during the game we had a situation, when one player has finished two roads by putting an intersection. Both roads belonged to that player. During the scoring - shou+ld we count intersection twice: for first and second road, or once for both roads?

Thanks in advance :)

Respuesta 1:
Yes, count it twice. Each road includes that tile, so each road gets points for it.

Respuesta 2:
It will get counted twice. Scoring of all features is completely independent (with the possible exception of the relationship between farms and cities, depending on your preferred farm scoring rules)



Tema 317: segments?
Pregunta:
I can not figure out how different 'segments' work! On the roads, it makes sense , each stretch of road, is a segment. What i cant make out, is how to tell what is a new 'city or farm segment'. when reading the rules, one part says "the player may not deploy a follower on a field,city, or road segment if that segment connects to a segment on another tile(no matter how far away) that already has a follower." but then, later on in the rules, it says it is possible for a road or city to have more than one follower. can any one help to shed some light on this for me?

Respuesta 1:
Two disconnected segments may get connected later by placing a tile.

Respuesta 2:
ok, so is a segment just a piece of city, on a tile? because it says that 'no matter how far away' leading me to believe that segments are or can be more than one tile in size.

Respuesta 9:
When you score an unfinished city at the end of the game, every tile (and every crest, if printed on a tile used in this city) scores 1 point.

When you score a finished city, every tile (and every crest, if printed on a tile used in this city) scores 2 points.,

Here an example (piocture from the PC version):

The bigger finished city at the bottom scores 14 points (7 tiles à 2 points).
If the game is over at this point, the bigger unfinished city in the north would score 5 points (4 tiles á 1 point and one crest à 1 point).
The unfinished city at the far right would score 2 points (2 tiles à 1 point), of course only if someone has placed his meeple on it! And so on...


If you're playing with cathedrals it's a bit different:
When you score an unfinished city at the end of the game, which includes a cathedral, no tile (and no crest, if printed on a tile used in this city) scores a point and the complete city is worth 0.

When you score a finished city, which includes a cathedral, every tile (and every crest, if printed on a tile used in this city) scores 3 points.

Example:

This finished city scores 18 points (6 tiles à 3 points, because of the cathedral).
If this city is unfinished at the end of the game (for example if the far left tile where the gray meeple's positioned is missing)the city would score 0 points, because of the cathedral.

I think some of the previous responses about segments were inaccurate and confused you.

A city segment is a piece of city on 1 tile. Commonly there is only 1 city segment on a tile but there can be up to 4.

A city is made of 1 or more segments which are directly connected. You can't add a follower to a city which already contains a follower. You can however join two separate cities with a further tile, which allows there to be more than one follower in a city.

Scoring is per tile, not per segment. Completed city = 2 points per tile, incomplete = 1 point per tile. (Ignoring other modifiers like pennants and cathedrals)



Tema 318: Shields on City Tiles
Pregunta:
Only just bought this game and I can't seem to find anything about these? The only thing I can think of is you score extra points (2) for your follower if it's on one of these tiles. If you have a follower within a closed city with no shield on you only score 2 points per city tile and non for your follower. I'm getting this info off the top of Page 3 in the rules book

Is that correct?

Respuesta 1:
For each completed city, a shield scores an additional 2 pts. For incomplete cities at the end of the game, they score 1 pt.

I'm not sure what you mean by a follower.The person or persons will the most meeples on the city score for it.

Respuesta 2:
Normal city pieces are 2 points if completed, 1 at the end of the game.

Tiles with shields are 4 if completed, 2 at the end of the game.

I think this is what you were saying, but I thought I'd be sure.

Respuesta 3:
The proper name of those "shields" are pennants.

Say you have a completed 5 tile castle with 2 pennants in your castle. As the castle is complete, you will score 14 points. This comes from (5+2)*2. In other words, each castle tile is worth 2 points and each pennant is also worth 2 points.

Say you have an incomplete 5 tile castle with 2 pennants at the end of the game. As the castle is incomplete, you will score 7 points. This comes from (5+2)*1. Each castle tile is worth 1 point and each pennant is also worth 1 point. This only happens for incomplete castles at the end of the game.

Respuesta 4:
Correct, a completed city is worth 2 points per tile and two points per pennant (shield) for the player that has the most followers in the city. If two or more people are tied for the most followers, they will both get the full value of points.

At the end of the game, any unfinished cities are only worth 1 point per tile and 1 point per pennant.

Cathedrals and other things can change the way cities are scored. It's easiest to just count each pennant as an extra city tile when scoring.



Tema 319: Putting tiles and finishing construction
Pregunta:
I have a question, during the game, when I put new tile and it finishes, for example city, and there is no meeples in this city, is it possible to put my meeple during this turn to this city and score points for finished city?

Thanks in advance.

Respuesta 1:
Yep.

Respuesta 2:
...And then you take it right back off. Those "targets of opportunity" are exactly why you don't want to run out of meeples!

Respuesta 3:
Here is the exact order in which you do things on your turn (in basic Carcassonne):

1. Place a tile
2. Place a meeple on the tile (if desired and possible)
3. Score any features closed by the tile

So yes, you get to place a meeple before scoring.

Respuesta 4:
But you have to have a meeple in stock. We call it "meeple on, meeple off" because we say it as we lay the tile and it absolves the player from actually moving said meeple out of its comfort zone (and reduces the earth-quake risk).

Tema 321: have I been playing the game wrong since i got it?
Pregunta:
I have always played where when there are two of your meeples in the same city/road/field that you get double the points, and triple for 3, but I just read in the rules that it just counts for majority.

I just wanted to make sure i was wrong beforee I began to play this why. Was I wrong?

Respuesta 1:
Yes.

The winner(s) gets all the points, no more, no less.

Respuesta 2:
Yes you were wrong. Features are only worth one value, no matter how many meeples are on it. The number of meeples only determine who gets the points, not how many.

Also remember if two players have the same number of meeples on a feature, they both will get the full value of the feature's points.

Respuesta 3:
Yes, you have been playing 'not according to the rules'. Although if you had fun and nobody thought the game wasn't fair then YES you have been using the Carcassonne components in the true spirit of boardgaming.

It's an interesting error that might actually be a great variant to the actual game. My gaming group would descibe it as 'leaching' onto yourself to get more points.

I hope you are aware that you can't (according to game's rules) place a meeple (follower) onto a feature that already has a meeple including your own. The only way a feature can have more than one meeple is if two unconnected features are combined into one through the use of a tile placement.

Respuesta 4:
With the 'big meeple' in the Inns & Cathedral expansion, when someone first explained to me that the big meeple "counted as double for scoring", to me that sounded like it was a score multiplier.

Yeah, similar to in real life where if there's a group of 10 people and 2 people vote to eat Italian food while everyone else in the group has no opinion, but then 2 more people suddenly chime in and say they're good with Italian food, it doesn't mean you're going to eat Italian food twice now that you got twice as many votes. Again, it just decides which option gets enacted, not how much to do it.

This is actually how   works. Any number of players may score the same feature, and majorities are not taken into account. Differently, though, features are not scored automatically when completed, and you must forfeit placing a follower in order to remove and score another.

Respuesta 6:
I always explain it like this:

There are a certain number of points to be awarded, and they will go to whoever has the most votes. If you have 2 guys, you have more votes than the person who has only 1 guy. The points are always the same amount, but whoever has the most votes (the most guys) will get the points.

Except ... if two players have equal numbers of guys in the one city - they both get full points - not half each.



Tema 322: Carcassonne Builder rule
Pregunta:
Hi, all.

I just bought the Builder/Trader expansion set for Carcassonne and I'm unsure with the Builder rule.

So I place a Builder on a road or city that already has a follower on. Then on my next go, I can have 2 turns. Do I have to place the tiles I pick near the city or road?

What if I can't fit a tile near the city or road with the builder on?

If anyone could help that'd be grand.

Also, on a side note, the expansion tells me that a Pig (With a follower) gets you 5 pts for each connected and completed city instead of 4. But I thought the original gave you 3 pts for a connected city. Can anyone clarify this for me,please?

Tema 323: Scoring farmers
Pregunta:
Just played the game a couple of times and I think that the people I played with were counting 1 point per square for the open green fields [like having the long unobstructed fields] but in the recent rules I am looking at that is not the way it is done. Are those old rules or someone scoring their own way?

Respuesta 1:
I have never heard of scoring a farm like that. Must be their own way.

Farms are scored based on the number of completed adjoining cities. Only the pig or pig herd changes the amount of the scoring. Not the number of tiles in the farm.

Respuesta 2:
That's someone scoring their own way.

Farmers score points for completed cities that are adjacent to their fields.

In the original rules, each completed city counted for 4 points, but if 2 or more farms bordered a city, only the farm with the most farmers (of a single player) got the points for that city.

In the revised rules, which most people nowadays use, each completed city counts for 3 points for EACH farm that borders it.

If more than one player has farmers in a field, the player (or players) with the most farmers gets the points.

Correction: in the original rules, only the player with the most total farmers in all farms bordering the city got the points, whether or not those farmers were in the same farm.

Quote:
1st & 3rd edition scoring? What’s that?

In brief, 1st edition farmer scoring is what currently comes ‘in the box’ with the RGG edition, whereas 3rd edition farmer scoring is what the original publishers of the game, HiG, use.

In more detail, 1st edition rules are scored from the perspective of the cities themselves: that is, you pick a city, and count the number of farmers on all the farms touching that city. The player with the most of those farmers scores 4 points. Then move on to the next city.

2nd edition rules followed almost immediately—after Carcassonne won Game of the Year (GotY), in fact. The original farmer rules were considered to be too difficult by the jury and they were changed; although after the change there were calls for Carcassonne to be stripped of the award, since the game that won was not actually the game subsequently sold as the GotY.

The 2nd edition rules changed to scoring farms from the perspective of the farms—pick a farm, count the farmers on it, and the player with the most farmers scores 3 points for every city touching the farm. But like 1st edition rules, each city could only be scored once, meaning you still had to keep track of which cities had scored 3 points and which not.

3rd edition rules came swiftly and removed that qualification, so that each city could now be scored multiple times. The great virtue of the 3rd edition rules is that you don't have to keep track of which cities have been scored, only which farms—and since you should remove the farmers after a given farm has been scored, this isn't overly difficult. Also, in the 1st edition rules, the farms aren't actually scored directly, but only indirectly, making the notion of 'farmer' scoring slightly misleading and difficult to grasp for younger players (this, essentially, was the jury's objection).

But whereas 3rd edition rules have been used in Germany for about the last five years, RGG chose to stick with the 1st edition rules. No one is quite sure why, but the usual arguments revolve around consistency (it would confuse people to change the rules) and authenticity (1st edition rules are the ones that won GotY, after all).

Respuesta 9:

@odde

For farms it is 3 points per city for each farm. The current city scoring is 2 points per tile regardless of size. This means a 2 tile city scores 4 points.

Respuesta 10:
scoring from the perspective of a city (aka 1st edition) and then paying off the farmers that supply it makes alot of thematic sense. But i agree that the 3rd edition famer-centric scoring makes things alot easier to score and understand. But it seems odd (thematically atleast) that a relatively small city could be "paying" 6 or 9 points for its food in that situation.

so...which version makes for a better strategic game you think? the farm battles with 3rd edition rules im used to, and encourage making lots of tiny cities once you have a farm, and pays no attention to cities touching multiple farms. Is the runaway farm less an issue in 1st edition or allow tighter scoring? curious.

and scoring 2 tile cities as 4 points definitely streamlines the rules, but does encourage the runaway farm issue and might be too "easy" a way to grab points, especially if a pendant is involved. Is this a case where simplifying the rules is good for similification, but not necessarily game balance?

seems these changes really do give the game a different tempo is some spots, curious what folsk take on the rules are. ive only played 3rd edition rules (despite having an older copy of game. so confusing...)

Do as you will but recognize that the 3rd edition rules are the current official rules. All expansions are tested and written to interact with the 3rd edition. If you are just playing the base game you can keep using the 1st edition rules no problem, if you starting adding expansions you are going to run into problems.

Respuesta 15:
I should have elaborated. RGG has since embraced the 3rd edition rules and has even gone so far as to change the rules in already published games and expansions. If you go buy a copy of Carc now you will get 3rd edition rules.



Tema 324: No place to put it
Pregunta:
Was playing a game the other night and for the first time we had a cloister tile drawn which is four sides of fields and no available field edge on the playing board so the player discarded it and drew a new one per the rules

"In the rare circumstance where a drawn tile has no legal
placement (and all players agree), the player discards the tile
from the game (into the box) and draws another tile to place."

my question is this discarded tile out of the game forever (which was my reading) or just put back in the box to be drew at some future point (which was what we did as the majority supported this ruling)

What if the tile was the last tile in the game? Would you put it in the supply and try to replay it infinitely?
I was beginning to wonder why we are still playing our 3rd game for 65 days

Respuesta 6:
The English rules say to remove it from the game (because they differentiate between stacks to draw tiles from and the game box), which has always struck us as stupid (cos while it can't be played this turn, the very next tile will probably allow it to be placed), so we shuffle it back into the supply of un-drawn tiles.

Just out of curiosity, how often has this happened to people? I've only seen it once so far...

Respuesta 7:
A less forgiving rule interpretation would be that the tile is put back in the box, and it's out forever, even when you start a new game.

I wonder how that would work?

I've played a butt load of Carcassonne and have yet to see it happen once. That being said, we play with all expansions, so that really limits the amount of "unplayable tiles" and "unfillable holes" that can happen.
Valid point. The new tiles from the expansions help placing tiles the other way too - there's less of blocked spaces where you can't place any tile.

The more I think of it, I think putting the tile away forever is the only correct way to play it. Even if nobody can be yearning for the tile that does not fit in right now, it might become a very valuable piece for any player later in the game (especially if it happens to be any other than the all-side city -piece). Putting it back into the supply kind of gives it a "second chance" rather than probably making the game a bit more interesting as yet an another rare piece is out.

Respuesta 10:
Thanks guys yeah this was first time it happened to us i think cause it was early in the game limiting the placements. The rule out of the current game makes the most sense to me as it is the most official and adds the most variety to the game

Same boat. Been a fair while since we played just vanilla carc, but even when we do, still haven't seen it happen.

Remember the other rule (often overlooked or ignored!) is that you should ask your opponents' advice before placing a piece. In all seriousness, they will most likely find a spot that you are sub-consciously avoiding. We have had plenty of times people claim a piece wouldn't work only to find a valid spot (or two) that has a legal placement. Not that they were purposely trying to ditch a piece but they just didn't see it.

Yeah, that does help with the placement, and usually there definitely are quite a few spots.

The more you play Carcassonne though, the better you become in visualising the tiles, and the more certain it is that no one else will find a place for a tile either, when you've already double-checked it yourself...

Tema 325: bushes on road , and wagon on cloister
Pregunta:
ok if you have the road with those little small green bushes are those a stop in the road? also if your wagon is on a cloister (as per the rules) and you score your points where can you move your wagon? also one more is the little brown bridge tile that has a bump (its a funny looking bridge) in it is it a stopping point also? THANKS

Respuesta 1:
You can place a wagon on a cloister. When it scores, you can move your wagon to any unoccupied, incomplete, adjacent feature (not a farm) just as when you score a road or city with a wagon on it. Usually this would be a road, but there is the one tile in Princess and Dragon that has a cloister inside a city. If there is no legal place to move your wagon, it returns to your supply.

I am also a bit unclear about the bridge question. If you are asking about the two bridges-over-roads tiles from Traders and Builders, no the bridges do not interrupt the road.

Tema 326: Farmer Question
Pregunta:
Tonight while I was playing Carcassonne this is what happened.
During the course of the game I put down three farmers.
When I placed them they were clearly in seperate farms but by end game all three of my farmers shared the same farm.
In this large farm there were 6 completed cities.
Now does each of my farmers score 24 points? or do I just get 24 points total because they are all in the same farm?
Thanks in advance.

Respuesta 1:
You just get the 24 points once. You score each farm only once at the end of the game.

Respuesta 2:
Good thats how we played it. Thanks

Respuesta 3:
The farm (or field) is only scored once and the player with the majority of farmers in the field receives the points for the field. You had the majority of farmers in the field so you would score 18 points (3 points per completed city). You would score 24 points if you were playing with the River II expansion and had the pig herd in your field, or with Traders & Builders and had your pig also placed in the field.

Tema 327: Placing a tile while closing a city, road or cloister
Pregunta:
I love this game but there has always been a question in my head if we have been doing this one thing correctly.
When you place a tile that ends a road, or completes a city or completely surronds a cloister can you place a meeple on that tile?
Ex. I place a tile the completes a city, can I them place a meeple on that tile for, lets say, a road or farm?
I assume you can but most people are so excited when they complete something that they never think about doing that. They just want to immediately get the points.
Please help..thanks!!!

Respuesta 1:
Yes you can.

Respuesta 2:
You can but you can't place a meeple on the road or farm after claiming points for completing your hypothetical city. That would be placing two meeples, and that's not allowed.

Respuesta 3:
As long as you have a meeple free to use before you place the tile,not as a result of placing the tile. Unless you have the wagon, but that's another story.

Respuesta 4:
The order of events is:
Place a tile.
Optionally, place a meeple on a road/city/cloister/farm on that tile, if not already occupied.
Score any completed road/city/cloister and return those meeples to their owners.

If you follow that order, all should be clear.

What you say here is incorrect. Scoring of points and placing a meeple are not related. You may only place a single meeple per tile placed. It doesn't matter if you score other features int he process.

Respuesta 6:
Completing a feature on which you already have a meeple and placing a meeple on another feature of that tile is often a great move. Do it when it is definitely to your advantage for a future scoring.

Respuesta 7:
You could even place a tile which completes two or more features, place a meeple on one of them (if it didn't already have a meeple on it), and score for all of them (if you had the majority of meeples on each of them).

Tema 328: Are points scored for completing cities with no Knights previously placed?
Pregunta:
If you don't place a follower, no points. However, remember the order of a turn:

1.) Place a tile
2.) Place followers
3.) Score features

3. The city (or other feature) is scored.
4. The Follower is then removed.

Quote:
It is possible for a player to deploy a follower, score a road, city, or cloister, and have the follower returned on the same turn (always in this order).

2. Deploy a knight, thief, or monk.
3. Score the completed city, road, or cloister.
4. Return the knight, thief, or monk.
I can't believe I missed that. Thanks for the help!

Respuesta 3:
Something to watch out for: the player has to have a meeple available in order to make this play. We've had some close calls where people were so used to doing this type of "quick score" abstractly that they almost grabbed the points when they didn't have any knights to play.

Good point. Thanks for the heads up!

Respuesta 5:
And, on an aside: While in Carcassonne you get no points if you complete a city and had none of your own Knights in it, in Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers you can claim a bonus tile play if you complete a Forest that has a gold nugget in it. If another player has a majority of meeples in that forest, they'll get the score for you completing the forest, but you will get to play the bonus tile. Adds a nice twist on the City-completion mechanism of the base game.

If you are playing by 3rd edition rules (or 4th if that is what it is up to with the Big Boxes), farmers score 3 points per completed city.

If you are playing by the old 1st edition rules (for those that purchased the RGG version more than a few years ago, this is what your rule set), then scoring would be 8 points as each city would give its points to the upper left field since the others are vacant.

There are no other point modifiers (pigs, barns) in this so those are your only two options. The field is self contained and cut off by the 2 football shaped cities so it does not touch the third complete tear-drop city in any way.

2 Cities, rule set determines if it is 3 or 4 points. But officially, this would score 6 points.

I know about all the farmer scoring discussions, but this question is specifically related to whether the city in the lower right counts for the farmer in the upper left. We all agree that it isn't counted, but one person mentioned that it could be argued that those 3 cities come together at one point and that point is adjacent to the farm.

In that case, I don't know that it has been discussed often. Adjacency is not at the "points" so the 3rd city is not legally touching the field. Likewise, if the meeple moved down one tile, he would no longer be touching the upper middle city. It is only what is physically touching the green field. The two cities block this out and while they come to a point, their field does not.

Look at it thematically as well as logically - presumably the farmer is scoring points from each adjacent city because that's where he is delivering his produce & livestock. Right? Good luck squeezing that cow or pig or cart full of veggies through the "point" to the 3rd city.

Tema 330: Do I Have The Current Version Of The Rules?
Pregunta:
Greetings To All,
I have a question for everyone. I just picked up a copy of Carcassonne today at a peddler's mall for $2.49. I am rather gleeful about it but now I am curious about something. The edition I got is the 2000 edition with Rivers 1 tiles included. So after looking around here I am not sure which version of the rules are the current ones being used. The 2000 ones that came with the game or the Compiled Annotated Rules Fourms post. Thanks everyone.

Respuesta 1:
It's sort of "overkill" for basic Carcassonne, but I would recommend downloading the PDF rules from Rio Grande for the latest "big box"...

http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=366

(Link to the rules is on the bottom right of the page)

That way you get a sneak peak at some of the other expansions, and if/when you do get them, you've got all the rules in one place.

Latest rules for the base game are on the same site...

http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=48

Basically if farmer scoring is 3 points per completed city adjacent to the farm in question, then you've probably got the latest rules already.

Tema 331: Cloister Piece: Can you also claim farm?
Pregunta:
sorry if this has been discussed.

I just got the game and wanted to know if this is a valid move:

For the cloister piece - do you have the option to claim farm? or is that piece only a cloister?

Respuesta 1:
Instead of placing a meeple on the cloister, you are allowed to place a meeple as a farmer in the land surrounding the cloister, yes.

(But, of course, if that farm already has a farmer, then you may NOT play a new farmer.)

Respuesta 2:
Agree. You can't use one meeple for both purposes or place two meeples, one for each purpose. If the cloister has a road, you can also place your one meeple on the road. If the cloister is on a road, you may place a farmer on either side of the road, assuming no farmer connects to that field.



Tema 332: Various rule clarifications
Pregunta:
Hi, I've read up on these, but still have some nagging questions:

Pig: If 2 farmers w/ Pigs share majority, do they each receive 4 pts/ city or does a single farmer have to own the field to get the pig points?

The Count: Still confused on end-of-game options. Big box rules let you move followers out to score completed features (which would be mostly for farm-scoring at the end). I've read somewhere (Matt Harper's FAQ?) you can additionally move followers to uncompleted features for partial-point scoring, too. Was this an HiG ruling?

Abbey and Mayor: Does the wagon have to move to adjacent features, or can it move, say, along a road across crossings and completed segments to a distant feature? (The example picture that shows it illegal to move to a road segment occupied by another follower fails to also say you can't move across the crossing.)

Die Pest: Rules state you can move active fleas when none are left in supply and all belong to one active plague region. However, rules seem to allow a choice for 2 (or more) active regions that have consumed all the fleas: deactivate the smallest numbered region (to generate latent fleas) OR allow player to move an active flea to divide the swarm (and thus generate a subset of latent fleas, but keep all plague regions active):
Quote:
A player may also choose to move a Flea that will divide the remaining Fleas into separate swarms. An active Flea with no connection to an active Outbreak is immediately turned to its passive side...

Must be physically adjacent so no travelling for the special movement of wagons. Of course, you can just pull it off the board and place it again with no restrictions (except farms).

Respuesta 2:
Translated rules from Spielbox are always badly worded, even if they are done BY Spielbox (maybe especially). Anyway, the ruling is this:

If all the fleas are active, you begin neutralizing outbreaks in increasing order. The highest number outbreak remaining stays active. Any fleas attached to that outbreak remain active. If there are STILL no latent fleas, then you take one of the active fleas and move it. If, by doing that, you separate some of the active fleas from the outbreak, then those fleas go latent and you MUST use those fleas first before moving more active fleas. If the latent fleas are reconnected to the active fleas, then they all become active and the process repeats itself.

Awkward yes, but it makes sense. We had problems too the first time we played the expansion.

Tema 333: Cathars vs Siege escape routes
Pregunta:
I've got the Carcassonne: Cult, Siege & Creativity which says knights in a besieged city can escape via a cloister adjacent to any tile of the besieged city.
Now I've read the Carcassonne: Die Katharer and it says knights in a besieged city can escape via a cloister adjacent to the Cathars tile.

Is this a deliberate discrepancy? Or a version change in rules? I was under the impression that Siege was a re-release of Cathars, so it seems that the later rule would override the prior, looking for second opinions.

Respuesta 1:
I never caught the subtle difference, assuming it was just a reprint with updated art.

As with all rule questions, it boils down to who you want to folllow: Hans im Gluk or Rio Grande. I prefer to follow HiG and not RGG because Jay has been .... oh let's say lax ... in his rules for Carcassonne.

Cathars is very specific that the Cloister must be adjacent to the Cathar tile itself. I play Siege the same way.

I am not sure if a) Jay deliberately changed the rules or b) misunderstood them, or c) meant the same thing as HiG but worded it with a little ambiguity, though this seems the least likely.

So I am going with B as is typically the case when the rules are off. though he would probably say A. But to give him the benefit of the doubt, one could argue a Siege is affecting the whole city and not just the breach in the wall caused by the Cathars. So it seems he took a thematic shift as well as a rules shift in this one.

So decide who you want to follow and stick with it. I think the original Cathar rules should be followed as I doubt HiG changed them. The Cathar/Siege tiles are meant as an offensive weapon. Allowing an escape lessens the blow to your opponent, but opening it up to any tile, not just adjacent to the tile causing the damage, seems to really weaken the intended purpose of these tiles.

Respuesta 2:
This difference was brought to my attention when the latest version of the CAR was released in 2009. Page 59 reads:

Quote:
The only difference in the rules concerns escape: in The Cathars, a cloister must be placed directly
adjacent to a Cathar tile to allow a knight to escape; whereas RGG’s rules for siege tiles say that a
cloister must be placed adjacent to any tile of a besieged city. For the sake of consistency, I’d advise
selecting one of these rules for both Cathar and siege tiles at the start of play; personally, I’d be
tempted to adopt the RGG rule here, simply because it makes escape much more viable.
The same page also explains why the artwork changed:

Quote:
Copyright prevented The Cathars being reprinted by anyone except Spielbox, and the siege tiles are
RGG’s rather elegant solution. They are effectively The Cathars in all but name; nevertheless, I would
consider them a separate expansion, rather like relation between The River and The River II, and a
welcome addition at that.
Could copyrights have also made RGG change the game mechanics?



Tema 334: Order of Operations
Pregunta:
My gaming group loves to play huge games of Carcassonne, therefore we include every expansion there is (except the stupid catapult). Due to this, we have seen just about every interaction between expansions you could imagine. Fortunately, between the rules that came with each expansions and the clarifications provided in the big boxes (we downloaded those rules) there is not all too much ambiguity when mixing expansions.

That being said there seems to be no rulings as to the "order of operations" used when calculating points. This has lead to some contention in our group. I will illustrate the ambiguity with the the following example.

You have a field with a barn (Abbeys and Mayors) in it. In this same field is the pig herd tile (The River II). You are calculating the points awarded to that field by a city that is under siege (Cult, Siege, & Creativity).

To score said city do you double the value of the city (due to the siege, per the rules from Big Box 2) with is 4 (due to the barn) and then add the additional point for the pig farm, thus counting the city as worth 9 points([2*4]+1)?

Or...

Do you score the city via the barn as 4. Then add the +1 bonus for the pig herd tile and then double the value of the city via the siege. Doing so would produce a vaule of 10 ([5+1]*2)?

Has there been any rulings as to how to address these situations? I only listed one example here but there are a couple others my group has encountered.

Respuesta 1:
You add the pig point first. In essence, the Cathar/Siege tile is doubling all points. So the pig scores double what it normally would: +2 instead of +1.

So no need to determine an order of operation for this one as you can double it first or after, just need to double all sources of points.

What other scoring ambiguities do you see?

Tema 335: can you create empty space surrounded by tiles?
Pregunta:
I'm quite sure I read somewhere in the past that you were not allowed to place a tile if that meant there was an empty space that was fully surrounded by tiles (ie: all 4 sides pre-determined).

I can't seem to find that anymore.

1) Was this ever a rule?
2) Can you create empty spaces?

Cheers!

Respuesta 1:
I saw a thread recently where somebody said they played this as a house rule, but no, it is not a rule, you can create empty spaces and it is a great thing to do to make it very difficult for somebody to complete a feature (because they need to draw the perfect tile). Especially good for cities because it halves the opponent's score and ties up one of their meeples all game.

Tema 336: Another 3rd Ed / 1st Ed question
Pregunta:
Basically:

1st ed rules (old edition): 2-tile cities score 2 points, farms are scored looking who has the majority of farmers touching a city, scoring them 3 points, doing this for each city.

3rd ed rules (new edition): No special rule about 2-tile cities, they fall into the general 2-point per tile city scoring rule. Farms are scored looking who has the majority of farmes on a farm, then scoring 3 points per each city touching that farm, doing this for each farm.

Respuesta 1:
Some of the editions (Mayfair Games Rio Grande Games) took a little longer to finally accept the "modern" rules, which are...

1) No exceptions for small cities... all cities score two points per tile, one per tile at end of game.

2) The majority of farms on a farm score three points per adjacent city.

The final nail in the coffin of the old rules was the entrance of the   expansion. The way the new barns interact with farms means you basically HAVE to use the new/modern scoring.

Small city (aka "town") scoring may affect the desire to place castles in   - if you're only getting two points by scoring the old way, then putting down a castle instead becomes much more of a temptation (a castle lets you share the score of any nearby completed feature).

Tema 338: Possible placement conflict. Please advise.
Pregunta:
What prevents one player from placing a city tile into another player's city?

I understand the placement rule:

Quote:
The player may not deploy a follower on a field, city or road segment if that segment connects to a segment on another tile (no matter how far away) that already has a follower (from any player, including himself) on it.
but ...

In the image below, can the red player place this tile to complete and score her Cloister even though it conflicts with the yellow player's City?

What if the Cloister wasn't there? Could the red player place this tile just to complete the yellow players city?

So I'm still unsure what, if anything, prevents one player from placing (or dumping) city tiles into another players city?

Please help me understand this! This is pretty much the only issue that I haven't been able to figure on my own. Thanks much!

Respuesta 1:
Sure, you can put the tile there...you just can't put a meeple on the city to try and share the points of the city. Since the city is now complete, Yellow now gets 6 points added to his/her score...and red gets the 9 points for the cloister.

The rule doesn't apply to placing tiles - just placing meeples.

Indeed, sometimes it can be a good play to dump city tiles into a players city to prevent them from closing out the city and scoring 2 points per tile...or to set up a situation where the city can never be closed, preventing the 2 points/tile AND locking up a valuable meeple from being used elsewhere.

Respuesta 2:
There's no restriction on adding tiles to another player's feature.
There is only a restriction on adding *meeples* to a feature that already has a meeple.

In your case you can play the tile, but you can't place a follower on the city part of the tile (you would be allowed to place a farmer in the field though if you wished).

Respuesta 3:
The only constraint on tile placement is that it matches any other adjacent tile sides, so this is a legal placement, regardless of its impact on any other player(s). In your example, red would score for completing the cloister, and yellow would score for the completed city.

Respuesta 4:
As we've always played it, the tile would complete both features -- the city for the yellow player and the cloister for the red player.

Respuesta 5:
Okay, thanks for all the prompt replies.

So if I wanted to (be mischievous), I could continually place city tiles into another players city to try to make it difficult for them to complete it?

Our house rule prevents this type of placement. I got so used to it that I guess I started thinking it was part of the default rules!

For some people, messing up others is their whole MO. You can make 'their' cities (since no one really owns the city, at least not if we can help it) harder to complete OR you can try to worm your way into someone else's city by placing meeples in adjacent cities and then connecting them. Your house rules make for an almost cooperative game. Come play with us some time....

Respuesta 9:
We have the "Inn & Cathedrals" expansion and in the last game we played, my son put the cathedral on my city, with about 10 tiles left to place. It was a huge city before that and if it had closed it would have been around 96 points.

Instead I got zip...

I didn't get mad... mainly because after placing it, he tried to close the city, but there just weren't enough tiles remaining.

I play Carcassonne with my mom and sister 99.5% of the time and they're just not interested in conflict. If we didn't house rule it this way, it probably wouldn't get much play. I occasionally place a tile in such a way that messes with them a little and I usually end up paying for it!

I don't think our house rule makes the game cooperative; more like multi-player solitaire if anything. We still love the game and it gets a lot of play!

Respuesta 12:
I didn't see anybody mention it, but this would be an active strategy if you use traders & builders or the king.

Traders & builders: it is the person who FINISHES the city who gets any commodity items found within the city. You increase your count of wheat and/or cloth and/or beer if such were on one of those tiles.

King: gives bonus points at the end to the player who built the larger city. If you have the king and want to keep the king, you will want to do everything you can to "help" the other players have smaller cities.

@Drenon88

In the games my group plays, we rarely mess with others, unless it's going to be the difference in a game. Part of the strategy is to prevent others from making big points.

In the situation in the OP, I wouldn't put the city tile there if I'm red. It's currently Yellow: 2 Points, Red: 8 points. If the city tile is placed there, it's Yellow: 6 points, Red: 9 points.

I'd much rather keep the 1:4 points ratio than increase it to 2:3. Getting 1 extra point isn't worth the opponent getting 4 extra.



Tema 339: A few confusing rules questions regarding expansions.
Pregunta:
Well, after playing a few games recently, we came across these problems. I'm hoping you can help us with them.

1. At what time in a turn does scoring take place? Right after you play a tile, or at the end of a turn? The problem came when a princess tile was played on a city and completed it. Would the princess remove a knight before scoring or not? This can also occur by completing a feature and then capturing a follower from the feature with a tower.

2. Can a player take the fairy if they placed a volcano, princess (by using the special rule), or dragon tile? You aren't allowed to place a follower on those tiles, except for the dragon tile. We play you can't take the fairy from it becasue you know the dargon's coming, but is there an actual rule against it?

3. Can the fairy protect a man on the tower?

4. With the count of Carcassonne, are you allowed to place a follower in Carcassonne if you add to a inn road or cathedral city? You may not technically be giving them points, especially near the end of the game.

Respuesta 1:
Q1 No the player which has a meeple removed does not score.

Respuesta 2:
1. The princess should remove the knight first, then scoring takes place.

2. You may move the fairy any time you do not place a follower - whether that is by choice or not.

3. Yes. The fairy prevents the dragon from entering the entire tile and protects everyone on it - including the tower meeples.

4. You can place a meeple into the City anytime you don't get points but the feature is completed. If all you8 have done is add to the feature, then you haven't completed it and it doesn't score. It is not just "giving them points" it is actually scoring it.

Respuesta 3:
With Question 2, as soon as you place a volcano or dragon tile you must move the dragon to the volcano or move it 6 spaces before any other action can be made.

Tema 340: Barn questions + misc
Pregunta:
Hi!

Some misc questions:

Can you add followers to a farm with your barn on it? If not, if you have another farm, and that gets connected to your other farm with your barn on it, do you know score that other farm?
Can you place a pig at a barn-farm ? How do you score that? +1?

Can you use a magic gate to place a meeple on a tile where the dragon is standing?

Finally a more strategic question:

What's the point in having a builder on an oppents road/city?

Respuesta 1:
1) You cannot place followers on a farm that has a Barn. If fields are connected through clever play, then those farmers are now scored at 1 point per city (I think, I don't have the rules with me) and returned to the supply. A pig adds +1 per normal.

2) Yes, but it would immediately be eaten so there is no point.

3) You can't place the builder on a road/city that is just occupied by your opponent. You must be present as well. if you lose your meeple (because of the dragon, tower, etc.), then the builder should be removed as well. So this condition where you have only your builder on another opponent's feature will never exist.

I don't think that understanding is correct. If a player adds to a city with a builder and does not play a meeple, he gets to move the fairy (it was on an opponents tile). He chooses to move it next to one of his meeple. His second turn begins and he scores a point for the fairy. This seems allowed. The rules only explicitly state he can't score two fairy points.



Tema 343: new player question about scoring
Pregunta:
Just got started playing this game tonight. Have a couple of scoring questions:

You build a city with 8 squares. However, your city has two followers associated with it (I understand that generally this can't happen). Do you score 16 points (8 squares * 1 follower) or 32 points (8 * 2 followers?)

Similarly -

Lets say the end of the game rolls around and I have 2 followers associated with the same 7 farms, and my opponent has 1 follower associated with the same seven farms. Do I score (7 farms * 3 points * 2 followers = 42) or (7*3*1 follower = 21) or even ([7*3*2] - [7*3*1 opponent follower] = 21)?

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
You can have two followers in one city provided they started in separate cities that were joined. Only the person with the most followers scores points. S/he scores as though there was only one follower there; points are not doubled. (16 points in your example)

Which version of farm scoring are you using (how old are your rules)? Standard rules (this used to be debated) is you score 3 points per finished city that touches on your farm. The number of farmers you have is irrelevant if you are the only one with farmers.

You can have two followers in one city provided they started in separate cities that were joined. Only the person with the most followers scores points. S/he scores as though there was only one follower there; points are not doubled. (16 points in your example)

Which version of farm scoring are you using (how old are your rules)? Standard rules (this used to be debated) is you score 3 points per finished city that touches on your farm. The number of farmers you have is irrelevant if you are the only one with farmers.
Exactly right. The number of meeples on a feature makes no difference in the scoring, except to determine who receives the points of a contested feature. If 2 (or 3 or more) players have the same number of meeples on a completed feature, each of them receives the full point value of the feature.

ok - another scoring issue came up:

Last tile is played, game over, and i have two farmers down-

Meeple A is a farmer attached to completed city Z.

Meeple B is a farmer attached to completed city Z (same as above) and city Y.

Assuming 3 points per farm, does A score 3 and B score 6 for a total of 9 . . . or do you NOT COUNT city Z twice, and thus only score 6 points?

Respuesta 8:
Consider each farm separately ignoring anything else. So in essence, City Z will count twice.

Check the latest final rules for farming which simplified it, standardized it, and makes all the expansions work. Since scoring is done by farms now, not by city:
Meeple A is in a field touching one finished city (Z) so 3 points.
Meeple B is in a field touching two finished cities (Z and Y) so gets 6.

Respuesta 10:
Yup, don't think about the cities at all.

Look at a farm. Say "who owns this farm? Blue has 2 meeples, red has 1. So, blue gets the points for this farm. Count the complete cities nearby: 1, 2, that one is incomplete, 3, and 4. 4 cities times 3 points each = 12 points for blue."

Remove those meeples from that farm so you don't mess up, then move to the next farm and do the same thing.



Tema 344: City Scoring with 2 Knights
Pregunta:
Hello all,

I just got a copy of the base this week and am enjoying it a lot so far. My wife and I were playing Saturday when a situation came up that is not mentioned in the rules, or at least I couldn't find in the rules.

I had placed a knight on each of two incomplete cities. Later in the game, I played a tile that both joined and completed the two cities - in other words, I have 2 knights in one city now. How should this be scored? Should I get double the points for having two knights in the city?

Thanks in advance for helping out a new player!

-D

Respuesta 1:
Unfortunately, you do not get double points. The city is scored as if you only had 1 knight on it.

Respuesta 2:
The advantage in having more knights is the city is it is harder for other players to 'take' away from you when scoring. Remember the player (or players if tied) with the most knights within score the city, the other players get nothing.

Trying to 'leach' on to cities not yet completed (or farms or roads) to get the majority of meeples is a key Carcassonne game tactic.



Tema 345: meeples placement
Pregunta:
When a meeple is placed in a city, farm, or road, and then an opponent has their meeple connected to your city, farm, or road, can either opponent just add a new meeple to the city, farm, or road if they can connect a new tile to it?

Respuesta 1:
As long as the meeples are alone in their structure when they are played on the board, anything that happens to merge their structure with another occupied one is legal within the normal rules of tile placement.

Respuesta 2:
I mean after they merge.

Respuesta 3:
The same rules apply. A meeple* needs to be alone at the moment it is played on the board.


*builders, pigs, barns, and anything else with special rules aside.

@Maxx_Pointy
The same rules apply. A meeple* needs to be alone at the moment it is played on the board.

Exactly. The test is whether there are one or more meeples already in the field, road, or city where you are adding a tile. If so, you cannot add a meeple with that tile (except for special meeples -- e.g., pig, trader, etc. -- which can be added if you already have a regular meeple on that structure).

Respuesta 5:
Holmes108
wrote:
Right. So after the 2 meeples have merged, you (or your opponent) can potentially lay another, separate city piece with a meeple, and then merge again (on a later turn). THEN you would be out-numbered 2 to 1.
The fun part about trying to do this is finding out if your opponents are paying attention.

We've become good enough at the game that it is usually caught the minute the meeple is placed on the tile. Then the 'negotiating' about how 'we are going to work together to finish this' starts.

In some cases, that works out and the two (or more) players make a big score together. There's also been some where that additional meeple somehow sneaks in



Tema 346: Number of meeples?
Pregunta:
I just picked up a used copy of Carcassonne which has only seven meeples per color. The rules state there should be 8. Do all the different Carcassonne versions use 8 markers or is there a misprint in my set and there should only be 7?

There should be 8. 1 to keep score and 7 to play. With 7, you could play fine if you use some other token to keep score.

Tema 347: Did I dream this rule, or does it exist?
Pregunta:
I recently got called out for trying to enforce a rule that I was very sure that I had read in the rulebook, but when I checked (on a different set than I learned on) it was not there. Could it be present in some other edition?

The rule is: When scoring a completed city that consists of only two tiles, you only score two points, one for each tile, rather than the normal two per tile.

I rather like the rule. But if it has never been an official rule, I'll suggest it but not push too hard.

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/551830/poll-what-rules-d...

I used to play with the older editions a good amount at a couple certain places, in addition to on BSW:
--Farms are scored per city (count how many farmers connect with each completed city)
--award 3 to 4pts per city
--completed 2 tile cities (aka "football cities") via knights are worth only 2pts

But ever since I played with newer editions at other venues, not to mention Carcassonne for iOS, my mind has slowly shifted towards the recent ruleset:
--farms are scored per field (count how many famers are in each field, then it's 3pts per completed city that touches that field for the player(s) with most control)
--3pts per city
--completed 2 tile cities (aka "football cities") via knights are worth the full 4pts

Tema 349: 2 points or 4 for a two tile castle?
Pregunta:
I'm curious what scoring rules more people play by. In my copy of Carcassonne, despite the 2 points per tile rule, the scoring is listed as 2 points for a two tile castle. My friends have later copies of the game that set the score at 4 points. In my opinion the 2 point rule for a two tile castle is a good one as I feel it pushes people to attempt to build larger castles rather than encouraging people to scoop up every score they can. Unfortunately it is now treated as a "House Rule", rather than an actual rule. Whats your take on this?

Respuesta 1:
We also have a "2-points copy". But since we also play the iPhone-Carcassone where you get 4 points we don't switch back to the "old" rules.

Respuesta 2:
With the latest US version put out by Rio Grande, the rules fall in line with the international version. Two tile cities are four points.

I don't think that the number of points is a strategic factor. If I own the field I am building the city in, I am going to put small cities in to maximize the farm points. If I am building in someone else's field, I will build large cities to minimize their farm points. For me at least, the point value of the city itself isn't a big deal.

Respuesta 3:
I play with the V3 rules, that is 4 points for a football city. That seems to be the version that the designers had in mind when they made the expansions.

I prefer how farms are scored by the field. And how that plays well with how the Barn   scores. And giving up 4 points to play a Castle ) is more interesting as well.

Respuesta 4:
[color=purple]I've played games where I kept track of the score for first and third edition rules. The strategy is only slightly different. Do you want to score 2pts per small city while the farmer score 4pts for it, or would you rather score 4pts while the farmer scores 3pts? My group prefers the latter (third edition rules). Especially since scoring the farmers is easier with third edition rules.

Respuesta 5:

Tema 350: The Cult and the Heretic Rules Clarification
Pregunta:
For anyone not familiar with the Cult and the Heretic expansion, cults act like cloisters. You can not create a situation where two cults are next to a cloister and vice versa.

Quote:
When a player puts a cult place directly adjacent to a cloister occupied by a monk of another player, and puts a heretic on it, then the heretic must challenge the monk. The same applies if a player places a cloister and monk directly adjacent to a cult place occupied by a heretic of another player. Once a challenge has been declared, the player (of those two involved in the challenge) who first completes his cult place or cloister scores 9 points as normal. The other player scores nothing and both followers are returned to their players. If a challenge is not resolved by the end of the game, both players receive the usual points as described [blah blah blah]

The Scenario:

Alice, Bob and Carol are all playing. Alice has a cloister adjacent to Bob's cult. What happens under the following scenarios:

1.) Carol places a piece that finishes both Bob's cult, and Alice's cloister.

2.) Carol places a piece that finishes Bob's cult, but not Alice's cloister.

3.) Bob places a piece that finishes both his cult and Alice's cloister.


My Interpretation:

I treat the rules as describing what happens to the players, not what the player does

1.) Both Bob and Alice get 9 points

2.) Bob gets 9 points, Alice's monk is removed and scores nothing

3.) Both Bob and Alice get 9 points


My Wife's Interpretation:

She treats it literally, using player actions, but restricts actions to cover gaps

1.) Carol is not allowed to do this

2.) Carol is not allowed to do this

3.) Bob gets 9 points, Alice's monk is removed and scores nothing


My Roommate's Interpretation:

He is more literal, and thinks any gaps in the rules result in nothing happening, giving Carol some sabotage opportunities

1.) The challenge is unresolvable. Pieces are trapped (pending any other actions like the dragon) until end of game

2.) Bob is not able to resolve the war, but Alice is still able to. Bob's piece is trapped until Alice wins or the end of the game. Note that Bob could actually complete Alice's city under this scenario to "save" his heretic and trap Alice's monk.

3.) Bob gets 9 points, Alice's monk is removed and scores nothing


So is any of us right? What's your interpretation?

Respuesta 1:
Wow! I haven't seen a mess like this for Carcassonne in quite a while. The Cult rules are not in any way as complex as your wife or friend make it seem. Rule gaps are just that. They are not an excuse to trap things on the table. They are awkward problems caused by a lack of expansion-interaction oversight by Hans im Glück and Rio Grande Games. Here is the easiest rule of thumb in Carcassone:

It rarely matters who places the tile.

The only exception really is with Traders & Builders since the person who places a tile receives the trade goods. But the rule stands pretty much everywhere else.

In your scenario, you are correct all three times. For the first scenario, regardless of who finished the cult and cloister, the challenge was a draw and both players get full (9) points. For the second, the heretic won the challenge and gets the points and the monk on the cloister goes back to that person's supply. Again, doesn't matter who placed the tile. Finally, in your third example both players tie so they both get full (9) points. Once again, it doesn't matter who placed the tile. I hope that helps.

One last thing, in Heretic-Monk challenges, the loser always gets their follower back after the conflict has been resolved (unless it is never resolved, then they "fight" until the end).

Respuesta 2:
I agree with Derek. I'll take it a step further.

Your wife is wrong because....
1) There is no rule against this placement. As long as all sides match to teh tile she is placing, there is nothing illegal about this. The only illegal situation that arises is if Carol was placing a Cult/Cloister piece that somehow managed to be in proximity to two or more Cloistrs/Cults in this location.

2) Same as bove.

3) Once a feature is complete it is scored. If multiple features are completed simultaneously, they all score. The challenge was a draw so they both get it as if they both equally shared in any other typr of feature.

Your roommate is wrong because....
1) Pieces are only ever trapped if the feature is not complete. Completing a feature releases all of them.

2) Too convoluted to rationalize! See above to attempt to unwind this.

3) Same point as your wife's above.

Respuesta 3:
I have to disagree with number 3. We play that the player who places the tile is the one who is considered to have completed his/her feature and is therefore the one who scores. I've never run across the other two scenarios because we never have multiple players (beyond 2). I personally would agree with you, Craig, on both of them.

What if player 3 finishes player 1's cloister and player 2's cult at the same time? What happens then??

Respuesta 5:
Derek is correct, it matters not who lays the tile.

Respuesta 6:
Derek, Brian, and Jonathan are correct. It may be a stupid thing for Carol to do, completing the features of both Alice and Bob, but it's perfectly legal. The only reason I can think of to give two other players 9 points each is if the tile placement also scores a huge amount of points (more than 9) for Carol, such as by completing a huge city where she has the only knight.

The cloister/cultplace challenge is not between the *players*, but between the monk and the heretic - the *followers*. If Bob had placed both the monk and the heretic, he still gets the points based on whichever one completes. If he can manage to complete them both at the same time, Bob scores 18 points.

Tema 351: current scoring rules

The bigger change is that each field is scored separately, with each connected town worth 3 points instead of 4. This is far more intuitive, and easier to explain to newbies. It takes a little skill out of the game, but is much better overall, imo. And now the German and English rules are the same.

I may have thought of it before, but today I was thinking about how you can play in certain ways in each game to ruin certain other possible plays you might fear could score well for your opponent(s). But really I was primarily thinking that Carcassonne is a better game from the balance standpoint. In scrabble it can be a nice lucky break to end up with a triple or double word score available with a 7 letter word that involves the letter Q, or like average, you can make a play for 5 to 20 points using average pieces and average multipliers.

In carcassonne the playing field is more leveled. There's still lots of luck, but choices you can make to make luck not as important for you and your meeples.

Respuesta 4:
I think comparative vocabulary can make just as much difference in Scrabble as the pieces you draw. I'm not sure they're that much alike IMO...

Scrabble is more of a manipulation game within the framework of the board, whereas Carc has you actually building the framework of the board, and trying to score within it as you adjust to the pieces and the board being drawn and played.

Respuesta 5:

Respuesta 6:

Respuesta 7:
I disagree that Scrabble is imbalanced. The game board (triple/double word squares) is known at the start, the available letters are known at the start, and the available vocabulary is known at the start. The only factor of luck is in the tile drawing (same as in Caracassonne). Knowing what/where/when to play your tiles is still the main challenge in both games.

However, I do agree they are similar games in the sense that a good player of either game will consistently beat a lesser player--with luck playing a minimal role.

Tema 354: Rule for multiple Meeples in spot
Pregunta:
So I apologize if this has already been answered in threads I've looked to no success.

My question is that in the event you are able to get more than one of your own Meeples in a city or road when completed do you get points for each Meeple, or are you just scored for ownership. Example: A city that contains a total of 5 tiles with no shields, has 1 yellow Meeple and 2 Green Meeples when completed. Does Green get 10 points or 20 points? Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
Just scoring for ownership. But if you have more meeples than anyone else, you have sole control and will be the only one to score.

In your examples, green gets 10 points (assuming no expansion bonuses) while yellow gets nothing. The 2nd green meeple only secures majority not any additional points.

Respuesta 2:
You score for ownership (or shared ownership of two people are tied), not how many meeples you have in a feature.

Green gets 10 points in your example.

Tema 356: Redeploying a meeple straight away.
Pregunta:
Hi all.

Just a quick question about Carcassonne. I can't find an answer in the rules.

All of my meeples were on the board. I placed a tile that completed both a road and a city at the same time. The road had not been claimed but I had no meeples to claim it. However I did have a meeple in the now completed city.

Can I use the newly freed meeple from the city to claim the road? Or can I not claim the road as I did not start my turn with a free meeple?

Many thanks.

Shane

Respuesta 1:
Order is place a tile, placwe a meeple, score the feature, then remove meeples.

So as your meeple is not "freed" until the last step, the period to place meeples is passed. Therefore, a just freed meeple can't be placed in the same turn. Therefore you could not claim the road if your supply was empty at the beginning of the turn.

Respuesta 2:
Hi Shane,

You need to have a meeple in order to claim a feature.
The meeple that you get back from the completed city you can use it the next turn.

[color=purple]This is only possible if your freed 'meeple' was a wagon (from the Abbey & Mayor expansion) and the road was connected the city that it was in.

Respuesta 5:
Well, the rule is that meeple is not available until next turn, but your way is more fun.

Like you said, you were losing badly, and playing your way gives you the opportunity to get big swing and make a miraculous comeback! That's a fun feature!

Big swings can be annoying when they are random, but this comes from strategic risk. You need to make a comeback so you risk committing more meeples to the board, and you get a big payoff when you're able to free one up "just in time" and redeploy him.

Tema 357: Different rules?
Pregunta:
I just bought the basic Carcassonne game. Both the box and the rules have a ©2000. I may be utterly confused but I thought I read that a ©2003 version of the rules was what most people used.

Am I mistaken? If not, where can I get the ©2003 rules and is my game set compatible with those rules?

Respuesta 1:
The game is compatible. It is just a difference in hoe you score farms and 2-tile cities. The 2003 rules are (probably) the Hans im GLuk rules, not the Rio Grande ones.

Rio Grande adopted the "official" rules with the 2nd Big Box that was issued. So if you have the first version, you have the old rules. If you have the 2nd edition, you have the correct rules.

You can also tell within the rules. Does it call out 2-tile cities separately as only worth 2 points total (instead of 2 points each tile)? Then you have 1st edition.

Does it call out farmer scoring to be 4 points each (instead of 3)? Then you have 1st edition. The differences between farmer scoring is a little deeper. But if you have the most current rule set, no need going into the differences now. If it says 4 points, we'll explain further.

Respuesta 1:
Woah there!

If two players have an equal number of meeples on any completed feature, they both earn the total score for that feature. If you have two meeples on a 9-length road segment, both players get 9 points.

Agreed

When you consider a feature like a 9-length road, it will ALWAYS score 9 pts. The question is, which player will get those 9pts? In the example you posted, they both rec. 9pts. If you had 2 followers on that road while your opponent(s) only had one, then you would have 'majority control' and only u would get the 9pts

Respuesta 3:
There are no fractions in Carcassonne.

All tied players score 9 points.

Respuesta 4:
I was going to ferociously disagree, and then found the applicable passage in the rules. For everyone's reference, I'll put it here:

the Rules for Carcassonne
wrote:
When two or more players tie with the most thieves or knights, they each earn the total points for the road or city.

Respuesta 5:
Yes, you've missunderstood the scoring before. Farmers can tie up in a similar way at the end of the game too and all get the full points out of the field if they've the same amount of followers there. Even with monks multiple players can all collect the full 9 points, if you're using the Count expansion.

"They each earn the total points" means exactly what it says. Every players gets the total 9 points for the road in your example.

Respuesta 6:
The only time you would use fractions is if you are playing with the fan-made expansion in which you use the mini meeples from travel carc.

Respuesta 7:
This is partly the reason of the popularity of Carc – you don't lose points by cooperating with another player, you just lose if they manage to get the majority. When building cities, it's often welcomed with other players, as they will help you complete the city. To sneak in another meeple in there won't get you more points – it will just make your opponent NOT get points. And you'll lose a valuable ally.



Tema 359: Carcassonne questions
Pregunta:
I am having some problems with some parts in carcassonne.

A: The wagon. When I complete a city, can i then move it to another city if the two cities touch?

B: The city of carcassonne. Can I move a meeple to a cult place from carcassonne in any way?

C: The cult place. Can i put a cloister near a cult place and in that way start a religious battle? Can i put a cloister near a cult place already battling another cloister?

D: The princess. Can i first place a princess tile to remove a players meeple while completing a city and while completing put a unit from carcassonne in to the completed city?

E: Do abbeys battle cult places?

F: If i move the big meeple from carcassonne to a cloister being completed, do the big guy count as two monks, taking all the points?

G: Can i put my mayor in carcassonne city if i place him in the castle?

Respuesta 1:
F: The big meeple only counts as two for the purpose of determining who has the majority on a road, city or field. For the purpose of calculating points, it only counts as one.

Respuesta 2:
D: Playing a princess requires you to remove a piece if possible, and I also believe the rules state that when you remove a piece, you're not allowed to place one the same turn.

A: The wagon. When I complete a city, can i then move it to another city if the two cities touch?
I suppose the original idea of the wagon was to move it through the roads. Translating from the Finnish edition rules it only states that fields may not be crossed and that the wagon should move to any directly connected road, city or cloister (or abbey/cult place/fort etc). If the cities touch clearly (not just at the corners), I would allow this tho.

Gabriel Lastname
@Znaillxor
B: The city of carcassonne. Can I move a meeple to a cult place from carcassonne in any way?
The cult place works exactly like a cloister, so you may move a follower onto it from the cathedral district.

Gabriel Lastname
@Znaillxor
C: The cult place. Can i put a cloister near a cult place and in that way start a religious battle? Can i put a cloister near a cult place already battling another cloister?
Yes, you may start a challenge by placing a cloister near a cult place that is not already adjacent to another cloister. If you placed a cloister near a cult place that is already adjacent to another cloister, that would make the cult place adjacent to two cloister, which is not allowed (it's irrelevant whether they are occupied or not considering placing the tile, but of course only if they are occupied it triggers the challenge).

Gabriel Lastname
@Znaillxor
D: The princess. Can i first place a princess tile to remove a players meeple while completing a city and while completing put a unit from carcassonne in to the completed city?
Yes. Other players too may move wood into the completing city from the city of Carcassonne.

Gabriel Lastname
@Znaillxor
E: Do abbeys battle cult places?
Yes. Abbeys count as cloisters in every way.

Gabriel Lastname
@Znaillxor
F: If i move the big meeple from carcassonne to a cloister being completed, do the big guy count as two monks, taking all the points?
Yes, unless there's already another big meeple / another player moves followers into the cloister. If you move your big guy from the cathedral district into a cloister being completed it counts as two followers when determining the majority. The player with a majority in the cloister grabs the points.

Gabriel Lastname
@Znaillxor
G: Can i put my mayor in carcassonne city if i place him in the castle?
Yes. But only into the castle.



Tema 360: Turn Summary for IPad

I've configured my complete Carcassonne turn summary webpage so that it can be viewed on an iPad (in addition to the iPhone) as a kind of pseudo-App.

To set up the app, navigagte to www.sciencegames.com/carcassonne/


in Safari, wait for the page to load, click on the plus icon at the top of the screen, and choose "Add to Home Screen".

This will add an icon for the Carcassone site to your desktop, which you can use to launch the "app". From this point on, you can simply click on this icon to access the rules, which will update each time you load.

The "app" works pretty much like the web page (here with all panels but scoring collapsed, and all options and most expansions selected):

Tema 361: Just a few questions for clarification
Pregunta:
I've recently started playing after playing online for a while. Let me say that I have the big box and that we started playing with the base game, inns and cathedrals, and traders and builders. Then we added one expansion at a time. Overall its been a great experience and i enjoy this game, especially two player competition with how to steal and prevent steeling and so forth. One of the things that has helped in general is to only use the 50/100 tiles to measure who's ahead and who's lapped who, we discard the tiles when we are on the same lap (since we've run out of scoring tiles before. but i do have a few questions.


Lets start with the Mayor,

1. If there is a mayor in a city with no pennents and its completed with him alone does it score anything? (my thought is no)

2. Can the builder be used with the mayor? in the rules section for the builder it states that the builder would go where there is a knight or theif already placed. since the mayor is a follower but not a knight would this be legal? (this also applies the the wagon as well)

Next is scoring when playing princess and the dragon.

3. There seems to be conflicting rules. when does the dragon move. in the section about the dragon it says that you place the tile, move wood (if you desire) score, and then it moves. but in the rules summary it says it scores afte the dragon moves. not sure which one to follow.

thank you

For all game purposes the mayor and then wagon are followers and builder can go where there is a follower. Just forget how the followers are called, treat them as followers.

The dragon is moved before scoring and may possibly clear the city, cloister or road in question before any scoring takes place.

for Completely Annotated Rules by Matthew Harper

Respuesta 2:
another question i had is one that somewhat conflicts and that's with clositers and cults. the way we have been playing it is that it there is a cult and cloister next to each other you can't play another that would make an illegal situation 2 on 1 in either direction. i would think that would be correct.

as for the dragon moving i'm stuck with not knowing which is proper since they both may technically be proper. based of where in the rules you read.

Respuesta 3:
Step 5:

* If the tile placed shows a dragon then the Dragon moves now.
* Note that the current player could have moved the Fairy in Step 3.
* Note that scoring has not yet taken place, so if the Dragon eats a follower in a completed area that follower will not count when determining the majority in that area for scoring purposes.

First move then dragon, then score any feature finished by the tile with the dragon icon just placed.

The rules say that you may not place a shrine in such a way that it neighbours several cloisters, and vice versa. But can I place a shrine in such a way that it forces a cloister neighbour several shrines? What effect does that have?
It leads to enormous problems when multiple cloisters and shrines neighbour each other.

Respuesta 5:
I know this is and older thread but i have yet another question and once again its from the princess/dragon expansion.

If a there is a city with a follower and builder, what happens to the builder once the follower is disposed of, either through bouncing by the princess or eaten by the dragon?

we have been playing it as it stands, allowing the builder action if they owner of the builder expands on the city, but that you can't just add a meeple but have to attempt to takeover the city again.

Tema 362: Rules for cities
Pregunta:
Hi all,

Please see the example below:



Is Blue allowed to place his follower onto the city (in front of him) or does this part belong to Yellow's city?

It is possible that these two parts will become independent cities, isn't it?

Thanks for any help in advance!

Cheers,

Respuesta 1:
Blue can place his meeple in the city in front of him. It is currently a separate city. That is a large part of the strategy of the game.

Your picture was perfect for illustrating your question, of course, so thanks for making it easy to answer!

Respuesta 3:
And, if blue places his large meeple and then connects the city, he may steal the city from yellow (unless yellow can place another meeple on a separate city piece and also connect it). That's part of the fun strategy of the game.

We play family-friendly for the most part, so we generally share cities equally, but sometimes it doesn't turn out that way. We have had as many as 4 or 5 of our 6 players in the same city, using this approach.

Have fun with Carcassonne. It's a great game.

Respuesta 5:
Large meeples come with the first expansion. They're worth more than a regular sized meeple.



Tema 363: I've got some questions about the game, and even more after reading some combined rules....
Pregunta:
I want to know whether the following is right or not, and if it is wrong, what is the right way to do or to calculate, thanks.

1. In the mini expansion "The Crop Circles", the "adding or removing" action is done after drawing tile and before placing tile.

2. In the mini expansion "The Crop Circles", the added follower can be any legal follower, for example, I can add a mayor to my small meeple in a city.

3. In the mini expansion "The Crop Circles", the added follower is in the same tile with the existing meeple.

4. In "Wheel of Fortune", if a tile with "pig moving" is draw but it cannot be placed, discard the tile and the pink pig need not to be moved.

5. I can retrieve any number of my imprisoned followers as long as I have enough score.

6. I can retrieve my imprisoned followers at anytime of my turn.

7. I can retrieve only one of my followers from each city containing siege tile(s).

8. Even if I have more than one followers in a same tile with fairy (placed by magic gate), I score only one point from the fairy at the beginning of my turn.

9. The meeple on a tower cannot get the one point bonus from the fairy at the beginning of a turn.

10. The end of a river of "River I" does not count as a "tile", the player place it cannot put meeple on it and draw the first tile from the tile pool immediately as his tile.

Respuesta 1:
I'll try to answer but the first few I can't help you with-hopefully no version troubles arise.
5)yes-but one per turn
6)Unsure-leave that to someone else
7)I *think* one per turn
8)Correct
9)Do not think this has ever been stipulated-I find a lot of expansion interaction has never been explained
10)Correct-although this is probably regularly ignored so there might be differing versions on this.

Respuesta 2:
I hope this helps.

1) No, adding or removing a follower is done after placing the tile and possibly claiming a feature on it. So, after 'moving the wood' and before scoring.
2) Added meeple is stated to be a follower, so mayors, mega meeples and wagons are allowed too. However, special figures arent.
3) The added follower accompanys any existing meeple of that player (yes, on the same tile, against the normal rules).
4) If a tile is discarded it's possible effects do not come to play.
5) Yes. Whether or not negative score is allowed, I am not sure. By our house rule, negative scores are allowed as they are allowed with the bazaars as well.
6) You can retrieve one imprisoned follower a turn only before 'moving the wood', as the rules state you're allowed to use that follower already during the same turn.
7) If there's a cloister (or a cult place) next to the besieged city, you're allowed to retrieve one follower a turn from that city.
8) Only one point, yes.
9) Dont know about this one, but I assume you can place the fairy accompanying this follower as the dragon is allowed to eat it too.
10) I dont know if the rules state something about this tile, but it would be illogical to draw another one as you're allowed to place a farmer on it.
[edit]
Checked the rules for the River I and they state the following: "When the river is finished, the lake tile is placed, and the game continues with the remaining tiles."
This could be interpreted either way.

Respuesta 3:
thx spacewolf009 and Nweeky for your help

Respuesta 4:
nick wong
@npcw
I want to know whether the following is right or not...
Some clarifications:

6: You can purchase one follower before each of your turns; you can exchange, for a just-captured follower, immediately after placing a tower piece.

9: Followers on towers are considered to be "on the tile" for all purposes, so they do score for the fairy.

10: There's nothing special about playing the river end tile.

Respuesta 5:
5. In case anyone's wondering why you'd want to retrieve multiple followers in one turn, imagine you have no followers in your supply and you are about to extend the feature containing your builder. As to whether you can, the rules specifically say one per turn, but they also describe the second tile placement from the builder as another turn; so you can ransom as many as you could have any genuine need for.

6. The rules aren't clear. The obvious time to want to do so is between drawing and placing a tile; it would be very hard to interpret the rules as prohibiting it at this time, and I see no reason why any different time would be advantageous.

8. "If a player starts his turn with a follower on the tile wjere the fairy is, he scores 1 point immediately!" I interpret that as meaning only 1 point (but 1 point even if the player's sole follower on the tile isn't on the same feature as the fairy).

Tema 365: Rules check - four sides spaces and four sided crossroads. FAQ?
Pregunta:
I have the simple Carcassonne and River expansion but have played a variety of other variations with friends.

I remember a rule which says that you can't close off spaces - eg to make a four sided space. However looking at the photos several people don't have that rule. I can't find it in the official rules so I am guessing it is just a house rule that my friends played with. Any ideas?

Also there is a field piece with essentially a cross-roads. It terminates a road from each of the four sides. What I want to know is whether the green field on that tile is in fact four different fields or whether they are connected through the centre of the tile - so maybe it is actually three, or one field on the tile.

Sorry if these are FAQs.

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
1) No you can create "gaps" as it were in the map. This is a fundamental strategy in the game - creating an impossible situation to prevent an opponent from scoring the full amount of points for a completed feature and getting his meeple back. This is also why the excpansions eventually gave us all combos and teh abbey tile was created.

2) If the roads are all connected, that means the fields are all separated. The tile with 4 roads at a crossroads makes 4 separate fields.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks Brian,

As for "If the roads are connected" that is precisely what the problem is. It is not clear whether they are connected or not as there is a tiny bit of green between them. I think the intention is that they are not connected - and that is what we play... four separate fields.

It's definitely not in any official version. A couple of months ago, someone asked the same question. There was some speculation that it was in the 1st edition... or the 2nd... or changed in one of the Big Box sets... or mentioned in an expansion... A couple of people said "yes, it's official. I'll quote the passage from the rules when I get home." Everyone eventually said... "ooops... no, it's NOT in the rules. I wonder why I thought it was?"

If you play Alhambra, you might have gotten it from there. "Holes" in the world aren't allowed in that game.

Quote:

I've played Carcassonne in tournament and it's always been treated as 4 different fields. I agree that the little bit of green space between the huts can be a bit confusing... but I look at it as the "back yard" for those huts. You don't want people farming in your back yard, so that's what separates the fields.

Respuesta 6:
Good call on Alhambra! I knew "this rule" existed in some form in some game. I just was 100% sure it was not Carcassonne and about 99.44% sure it wasn't in any of the spin-offs. But it is definitely a rule in Alhambra.

Sorry for the ambiguity in my response. What I meant was: if the roads are connected - which they are because it is an intersection - then by default, nothing else connect through them. So if I have a tile with an X through it because of the roads, none of the 4 corners connects.

If the road did not connect, because it went underground as a tunnel or it was the tile where the roads make a baseball stick pattern, then the fields are connected. By these intersections bring together all the roads and end that segment.

Tema 366: Farms and the end/start tiles of the river
Pregunta:
I was playing yesterday, and a question arose. Let's imagine, for a moment, this is an endgame situation. We're trying to count the points for the farms, and things look like this:



I know all players, in this state of things, should be tied, but I wanna know if the farms shown are connected or not.

There's a road blocking the black/green zone and the red/yellow one, but I've always had trouble determining whether or not the start and end of the river can join farms in a situation like the one portrayed above.

So, the questions are simple:

Are the black and green meeples on the same farm?
Are the red and yellow meeples on the same farm?

Thanks in advance.

Respuesta 1:
I've always played yes and yes. Dropping an early farmer on a river end can be a good strategy if people don't cut it off quickly.

Respuesta 2:
I agree: definitely a yes and yes!

Respuesta 3:
Oh, well, I lost. Thanks.

Respuesta 4:
The way I explain this is that when determining farms you can treat the river just as if it were a road and the spring and lake tiles work just like single road cloisters.

That's a great way of putting it, I'll be sure to remember it.

Respuesta 6:
My general rule of thumb is, "follow the green space".

If there's no green space to connect tiles, the farms aren't connected. If you've got poorly cut tiles this could be an issue, but I've never seen tiles cut so bad that the green space is not there on these tiles.

Respuesta 7:
These are very good questions. We've played with different sets of rules, and I too wonder which one was the game's main rule, if one exists?

Sometimes we allow the green spaces on both ends of the river to be accessible making the farmers in your example share castles. Other times we play with the ends of the river being two idle tiles; Noone can place farmers on it and noone can use the green on these two tiles for farmer influence on castles. When we use this rule the consequence is that you have to build around the two river endings to connect each side. This demands a lot of tiles. If you play with this version we have played that the castles that are connected close to the river ends block farmer influence (as in your example). This doesnt really look good, but is an alternative.

Which is the right way to play I do not know.

Respuesta 8:
The correct ruling is that the Lake does not split the farm and neither does the Spring. However, if you own the Spring tile from the GQ expansion then that Spring does indeed split the farm.

In the above example Red and Yellow share farms and would each receive 6 points for farm scoring as do Black and Green (official HiG and RGG rules (AKA 3rd edition)).

Respuesta 9:
More responses after all this time, that's weird. Thanks anyway!
I really love farmers, they make the game more complex and competitive, unfortunately I lost my copy of Carcassonne and in my gf's house they don't use them because there are littl girls and it can be hard to keep track of what's going on with the farmers. I'll keep trying to get those lazy, troublemaking sun-bathers back.



Tema 367: The roundabout tile
Pregunta:
What is the rule for the road with the roundabout tile.

1. Do you have to complete all three ends before you score ?

2. If you have closed two ends can you refuse the score and keep your meeple on the board to score when you close the third end.

Respuesta 1:
This probably belongs with the expansion that had the 3-way roundabout (not that I know that one off the top of my head), but anyway:

1. Yes

2. You couldn't take it off anyway until all 3 ends are done.

There's also a 4-way roundabout with Catapult; you need to finish all four ends for that one.

Respuesta 2:
All the catapult tiles consist of the fair, a feature which annoys me a bit as a non-carc like image. The 4-way roundabout is the tile on the top left, and the one with the cloister is interesting as well. We play by the house rule that you can choose to end a road to the yellow zone, making it possible to score 1 point roads, or to just place a field next to it. The original 3-way well-roundabout is from the Abbey&Mayor.

[/q]

You dont have to play with the catapult to use the tiles, but it definedly can be fun if you do. I've been using these rules for the fair tiles to make it fit better to the overall theme of the game:

1. Place the tile with the fair according to normal rules.
2. You can choose to place your follower on some of the features of the tile (not on the fair), or instead of that you can choose your opponent's follower from his/her stock (not a special figure) on to the fair.
3. If you chose the second option, your opponent's follower stays on the tile "visiting the fair" until it's the turn of the owner of this follower, then he can either: a) leave it there for the turn, b) pay points to get it back to his supply, 1 point for each segment surrounding the fair and one for the fair itself (so to lose 2-9 points). If the follower is still on the board at the end of the game it's scored just like a cloister, gaining points for the player. The player may use the follower on the same turn s/he payed to get it back.

Totally off topic for this thread, but you started it: I absolutely hate this tile. It obviously is meant to have roads on both sides of it (compare to the image of the Fairs on the other tiles) yet HiG stupidly printed the roads yellow and gave nowhere near enough room to really be able to claim it. Your house rules seem fair enough considering the ambiguity. I just hope someone gets a proper answer from HiG someday regarding that tile. It is quite possibly my least favorite in all of Carcassonne-dom.



Tema 368: What is a cloister??
Pregunta:
Are all the cloisters completely surrounded by farms? There are a few tiles that look like a cloister, but have a road leading to it? Is that actually a cloister or just a "road ender"??

Respuesta 1:
Cloisters can have all other terrain as surroundings. Depending on what expansions you're using, there are even cloisters inside cities, and cloisters with four-way road intersections. You then have the option of placing a meeple either on the cloister or on the other terrain feature(s).

Cloisters are always the same size and appearance, as illustrated in the game manual. The small buildings are just decorative artwork.

Respuesta 6:
Thank you so much Chris. I have heard that pictures are worth a thousand words!!!

Respuesta 7:
To clarify, a Cloister is a big honking building, a feature on the tile, and not the tile itself.

In basic Carcassonne, there are 4 tiles with a Cloister completely surrounded by empty field, and 2 tiles with a Cloister completely surrounded by empty field except for one road segment that ends at the Cloister. The River, which is probably included in your base set, also has 1 tile with a Cloister. On that one, there is a piece of river, and a road that goes over the river and into the Cloister.

So, the "ones with a little tiny building and a road leading to it IS a cloister." would be a tile with 3 places you could place a meeple. You could place him on the Cloister itself, on the road leading to the Cloister, or lay him in the field as a farmer. The little buildings are decoratively only and should be ignored.

Whether this is helpful or confusing, I have no idea.

Respuesta 9:
In the base set, there should be four cloisters with only grass around them, and two cloisters with a single road leading to the door. The building drawings are quite different - but both kinds are cloisters.

I'm not sure what the rules look like lately, but in the original rules, the one with a road was used as the example on page 1 (with "cloister" as the label) in the images of features that can appear on tiles. The one without any roads was used for the example of followers on features (with "monk" and "cloister" as labels) on page 2. You just have to know both types are considered cloisters, but none of the other little buildings scattered around the tiles quallify. A lot of "tiny" buildings are just farmhouses.

If you use the river expansion, there should be one more cloister - of the type with a road.

BTW: We call it a monastery.

Tema 370: No holes-rule?
Pregunta:
Yesterday I played Carcassonne with a friend (it was the first time I played Carc with her). I was very surprised when she said that creating "holes" is not allowed. I always thought it was allowed.

I didn't want to argue, but when I got home I checked the rules of my Carcassonne copy. I didn't find a word about whether holes are allowed or not. My boyfriend said that he was pretty sure he had seen a set of rules were the creating holes was forbidden. But on the other hand, aren't there some tiles in one of the expansions (Abbey & mayor?) that are used for filling holes? Because in that case, creating holes can't be forbidden...

So, my actual question is, has the rule about creating holes changed at some point?

Respuesta 1:
I haven't heard of that rule in Carcassonne. Part of the strategic play, I believe, is to sometimes place tiles that make it difficult for another player to complete a feature. This includes creating a hole that is sometimes impossible to fill with the remaining tiles. I believe that is part of the challenge of the game.

Respuesta 2:
Hello.
I think it´s possible to create them, in my group we call them swamps, cos its very difficult to build on them ¬¬
See you.

Respuesta 3:
Not only is creating "holes" allowed, it's a good strategy to do against your opponents, as it makes it harder for them to complete structures.

If I'm playing a laid-back "nice" game, or against sensitive people, I tend not to try to do holes. But if I'm playing a cut-throat game against a talented opponent, oh yeah I'll start forcing those holes!

I've never seen a rule forbidding this in any edition of Carc.

Respuesta 4:
Sounds like a house rule / personal preference to me.

I have a friend with whom I Carc quite a bit. He prefers a "pretty" board with as few holes as possible. It took him a while to learn how to overcome the distress of my boning up the board. Once he figured out how to play on an ugly board, it got real interesting. I started trying to make "pretty" layouts just to mess with him. We tend to see higher scores on more complete boards. I guess it depends on what the goal of the game is. Is it for fun only, max points, to win no matter what, have fun, etc.?

Respuesta 5:
1 person I played with didn't like holes, and would fill them in as soon as she could, as soon as they appeared. They're no rules forbidding holes, and I've seen plenty of them when playing on BSW. For her, I think it was moreso a psycological/OCD thing. I wouldn't know if it'd be "right" to exploit such a 'weakness', but that game, no1 deliberately put holes in just to make her crazy.

Respuesta 6:
holes are definitely allowed, and you are correct - the Abbey and Mayor expansion has a tile specifically for holes!

No, the rules about holes have not changed. You can still create holes and it can be an interesting part of the strategy of the game.

Maybe your friend didn't remember the rules correctly? Maybe there is a difference in translation if you were not using English rules? Or maybe your friend just prefers to play "friendly" games and added that rule?

You should make a bet with your friend that it isn't in the rulebook... something like "loser has to be a slave for the length of one Carcassonne game". Slave, get me a drink! Slave, pick up my next tile! Slave, sing and dance for me!

Sounds like it could be a memorable game.

By your friend's logic, neither red or black could complete their cities with the tile that was just drawn. So rather than have one hole, you've got a canyon.

We had a lot of those canyons in our game and a lot of features were not completed at the end because of those. In a situation like in your picture, the drawn tile would have had to placed somewhere along the outer edge of the board.

I totally agree with those of you who say that creating holes is sometimes part of the strategy.

I was wondering where my friend had seen this rule but I couldn't find it anywhere even if I checked the forums and the FAQ. I guess she's just interpreted the rules wrong.

Respuesta 13:
Creating holes IS allowed.

However, my group doesn't like the holes so we have the following house rule: Holes are allowed. If you fill-in a hole (three or four sides exist on the table), then you get a token that may be redeemed for a free, extra tile on a future turn. This simply creates incentive to fill-in the obnoxious holes.

My copy of Carcassonne is an early edition that doesn't even have the "Spiel des Jahres" logo on the cover, and I am 95% certain that it does have an explicit rule saying that "holes" are illegal. (I am not at home at the moment so can't go check.) Sounds like that rule (assuming my memory is correct) was eliminated soon afterwards, though. Sort of like how the farmer scoring is different in every printing.

EDITED TO ADD: Well, now I am at home, have reviewed the rules, and wouldn't you know THERE IS NO SUCH RULE. You can make all the holes you want. And even though I do own Alhambra as well, I had Carc for two years prior, and I am fairly certain that-- for some bizarre reason-- I thought right from the start you couldn't have holes. I'm now at a loss to explain why I was so sure that rule existed... it seems that at least I'm not the only one.

If I make a hole, I'm probably making one that's impossible to fill.

In two player games, denying your opponent a certain number of points is just as good as scoring those points for yourself (assuming your goal is to win). If you can block a feature from being completed, then you are denying them points (ie, the doubling of the city), but most importantly, denying them their meeple. That's worth a lot of points toward the end of the game.

Not really. You should only have 3 or 4 scoring items at a time. You can only play a road tile on one of those incomplete roads.

Toss in a couple of meeples on features that can't be completed, plus maybe a couple of farmers, and you are at 7-8 meeples. However, the more meeples you start with, the easier it is to leave them as farmers without disrupting your other scoring.

Reducing the number of tiles is the way to control the length of the game.

Respuesta 7:
Hello - there's another way of reducing the time - use an alarm clock; once it start ringing, you can start the final scoring ( after finishing the round in progess ) :-)

Another way of reducing the tile, is to draw tiles AFTER placed the tile, meeple and scored. So the players can use their time for seeking the best place holding in their hands, not just watching and waiting.

Tema 372: Which rules should a beginer use? 1st or 3rd edition?
Pregunta:
My wife and I will start playing this game soon. I have heard that there are several versions of the rules out there... 1st edition and 3rd edition. (What happened to a 2nd edition?)

Frankly, starting out with know real playing experience I don't have a problem picking either version to use. However, my wife sometimes gets a little confused with rule switching so I would rather just pick one to teach her. I have also read here that 3rd edition is the rules of choice for the expansions... if we ever get into those.

Should I just start with the 3rd edition rules and ignore whatever might come in the Core game's box? Is there a good fundemental reason why a beginner should choose the 1st edition rules?

Finally, can someone post links to the two sets of rules online so I can print them out and study them a bit?

How does it unbalance it? It can make field scoring very important, but only if you allow fields to get very large.

Respuesta 7:
I am a huge advocate of the 3rd edition rules. Two main reasons:

1) This is purely subjective but I find that the way to handle scoring is easier to explain and grasp. The reason is that it mimics how the other features are scored. Instead of going city by city to score the farms (1st ed), you go farm by farm to score farms (3rd). In addition, once you score a farm with 3rd edition, you can remove the meeple and know what is left to score with a quick glance. In 1st edition, you had to leave meeple in the farms because another city might yet to be scored. We just found it harder to keep track of what had been scored.

2) This is objective: All of the expansions were desgined with the new rules in mind (OK, I don't know if that is true for the first couple but I believe so). As they were developed, Rio Grande had to keep adjusting the expansions to fit into the 1st edition and it created a bit of confusion. It finally got to the point with Abbey & Mayor that it wasn't a simple fix and RGG finally switched over to the 3rd edition rules.

The other thing that is overlooked in these debates is that scoring of cities changed. But we get so hung up on farms we forget about this. Scoring changed so that 2-tile cities were of equal per tile points as the otehr cities (1st ed they were only 1 point per tile or worthe 2 points total while in 3rd edition they are 4 total with each tile being worth 2 points). the reason it was there before was to encourage buildin bigger cities and not closing everything off. But we always naturally expanded anyways and I have never had a game where I couldn't place a piece. So I was glad this rule was dropped.

I think you have things reversed. This is the main complaint about 1st-ed field rules. In 1st-ed there were really huge fields that could greatly impact scoring, and the cities were worth 4 points each. With the 3rd-ed rules, you just start your own field on the other side of the city, so the scoring swing is much smaller. As mentioned elsewhere, creating "football" cities is also more beneficial than in the 1st-ed rules. Now creating even a 2-tile city (4 pts) is worth more than farming it (3 pts).

There was absolutely nothing "wrong" in the first edition, just a couple rules that made the game more complicated than necessary.

The first edition was printed and sold something like 80,000 copies before the game was nomniated for the Spiel des Jahres. And for the first time ever did Hans im Glück receive a huge feedback on the postcards they have always included in their games. Something like 30,000 resonses, where maybe 5,000 would have been the norm. And apart from a lot of appraisal of the game, most people had questions about the farmer rule.

So in order to increase the chances of winning the award, the rules were changed - and the game actually won.

However, people still complained, and to be honest was the 2nd ed. rules just as complicated as the first - even though the scoring itself was easier to calculate.

So eventually did the rules changed to the final 3rd edition, and at the same time did they remove the other 'anomaly' in the scoring: that the small two-tile cities should only score 1 point per tile instead of the standard 2 points per tile.

Rio Grande Games kept the original rules in attempt to 'not confuse the customers'. However as more and more expansions came out, it became increasingly dificult for people dicussing the game across borders to understand the differences, so when the Big Box set came out did RGG finally embrace the 3rd ed. rules which are now 'the official Carcassonne rules'.

Respuesta 15:
This opinion's going to be a bit of a change from the others in the thread. I don't think that the rule sets are all that different. I'd recommend reading both sets of rules, and going with whichever makes more sense or feels more natural to you.

Personally, I like the first edition rules. Farms score a little differently to roads or cities - cool. I like a little variety. I also like two-tile cities being worth only two points, as this creates incentive to go for slightly larger ones.

I haven't yet played with Abbey and Mayor, and one of the (minor) features of that expansion (the barn) won't work with first edition scoring without modifications.

I also didn't see a response to your question of what happened to second edition scoring, so forgive me if this is repeating someone. As I understand it, the rules were changed to a second edition, and then fairly quickly, changed again to a third. This was quite some time ago, so the only reason we still have two editions of rules in common use is that while the German manufacturers printed the third edition rules, the English editions were printed with first edition rules up until quite recently. Second edition is seldom mentioned, but I *think* it is basically 3rd edition farm scoring, with cities made of two tiles worth only two points, and perhaps other changes. This is what is implemented on Brettspielwelt, a popular online version of the game.

It should be noted that the rules didn't change for the first Big Box. I recall at the time that it would have been the perfect opportunity to "bring the world together" but RGG did not take advantage of it.

It wasn't until the release of Abbey & Mayor that he left the rules "as is" without trying to retrofit them. Shortly thereafter, the base game made the switch to 3rd edition very quietly. By the time Big Box 2 came out, RGG finally had a complete 3rd edition ruleset.

At least, that is how I recall it happening. Besides Abbey and Mayor, I didn't purchase any of the above but I did follow the progression.

Would you be able to fit your farm equipment through a gap that small?
In the 17th century, your family, a horse or ox, and a plow would all fit through. :-) But the intersection blocks the farm anyway.

Respuesta 8:
I think there are 2 buildings with 3 gaps and 2 buildings that touch so play it as 2 farms. Much debate over this one today in our house.

Respuesta 9:
Look up the "rules lawyer" thread.

You're going against the spirit of the rules by arguing typographical issues. If there is a road, river, or town, it limits the farmland. If there is a X road crossing, it limits the farmland in all directions.

Would you also argue that because a town tile is printed slightly off-center, you can worm yourself through between two cities in the situation below?

You are clearly wrong. It has been defined that this art is an intersection. It separates all roads and all fields from one another. There are no city buildings on this tile.

Tema 374: River Two-lakes
Pregunta:
Does anyone else find the rules in the river just a little stupid or even ambiguous? it says to put one of the lakes in with the other tiles however, this meant my game yesterday ended with a 3 tile river. Do others just replay the tile or what?

Respuesta 1:
Well, I don't find it stupid or ambiguous as it is just meant as a variable to begin the game. However, we prefer to use all tiles so we don't allow the river to cap early.

Since we use the river split and both springs, we let the lakes get mixed in with the rest of the tiles. When it pops up, if you can continue a river after closing the branch you are on, then you are allowed to place the lake. If you would close off all branches early, then you set it aside and draw another tile until you get a river piece.

In this way, we might have a short river with another river with two long branches; or a long river with another that has two branches, or whatever. But we use all the tiles.

Respuesta 2:
I'm not sure which rules you are referring to, or which version of the rules, so they may differ. The rules I have say to lay the spring down, to start, set aside the lake, and shuffle the river tiles. After the river tiles have all been laid down, the lake is placed at the end.

Maybe you're talking about The River II ?

Respuesta 3:
You had the spring and fork already played on the table, as per the rules, right? So that the rest of the river tiles would go onto the other side of the river, yes?

(Also, think this question would be better placed under the River 2 game, instead of the mothership, but whatever. )

Respuesta 4:
We actually start with the T. The spring and two ends are pulled out and set to the side and the rest of the river is mixed. Once all of those pieces are played, the three ends are mixed and drawn and we proceed from there.

Respuesta 5:
We also start with the T. Then shuffle in all the rest of the river tiles and then build up the spurs until they all end. So, sometimes you get hardly any river, sometimes long rivers, but this adds to the variety of the gamestart giving it much variety.

Respuesta 6:
The river II states that you start with the spring tile, then the T tile, then the rest of tiles mixed up, but keeping the lake apart as the last river tile, whoever places the lake can´t move wood and draws a new tile from the regular game and moves wood if wanted.



Tema 375: Deploying the robber (thief?) on crossroad tiles
Pregunta:
Question: On a tile with a crossroads - do you have more than one type of robber deployment? I.e. on a tile with a "T" junction, must you choose between the left part of the "T", the right and the bottom part?

Out of all the examples I see, none of the junctions contain a thief - is that by design (they're not allowed on those tiles) or just an oversight (seeing as how the rules do contain examples of multiple farmer placement options on single tiles).

Respuesta 1:
T junction is considered three separate roads, I guess. You can place a robber, but you have to pick which road. Same thing with + junction, and a road that has a cloister, etc. (I'm not sure if these tiles are part of the base game or the expansion)

Respuesta 2:
Great, that's what I thought. Thanks.

Too bad they don't include such an example in the rules.



Tema 376: Rule Conflict between base and T&B. Help!
Pregunta:
In the rule pamphlet I have that comes with the game, it states "3 points for the player who has the most farmer in each farm supplying each completed city.

In the T&B rule page, it says "When scoring the farmers at the end of the game, the player earns 5 instead of 4 points for each city he scores that has a pig in the field with his farmer(s)."

So, one says cities are worth 3 each to farmers, and the other says 4. We played with 3/city and 4 with a pig. Was that right? Which one is wrong?

I looked around the forum to see if this had been asked before and couldn't see any. Sorry if it is a double post.

Respuesta 1:
You are dealing with different editions of the base game and expansion.

First edition rules had a different way to score farms that gave you 4 points for each scoring feature (which is what your expansion is still stating). Third edition changed the way farms were scored and made them worth 3 points each scoring feature instead.

Hans im Gluk has been using 3rd edition for many years. Rio Grande has stuck with first edition rules until very recently where they finally decided to change to match. I think this mostly happened because expansions kept being designed with this rule change in effect and it became increasingly harder for RGG to keep bending the rules to get them to fit the first edition base rules.

So how you play is your choice, you will just need to remember what way that is and how many points they score. Regardless, the pig just adds +1 to whatever base you are using.

Respuesta 2:
3 points per city per farm became "official" for Rio Grande versions with the release of  , which pretty much forced their hand into using the new scoring otherwise the barns would make no sense. Validated by the all-in-one rules in Big Box 2.

Tema 377: Beginner's quest about farmers meeting each other.
Pregunta:
Consider blue has 2 farmers on 2 seperated fields. Somehow someone put a tile to connect those 2 field into 1. What happened then?
a, blue retrieve 1 of his farmers back.
b, keep both of them on their tiles and count as 1 farm at the end of the game.
c, keep both of them on their tiles and count twice at the end of the game.

and further more. consider 1 blue meets 1 blue plus 1 red, what happen to the red one?

thanks.

Respuesta 1:
The first answer is b. You never pick up your farmer back up once placed. You also do not score twice.

The second case is similar. The 2 blue farmers and 1 red farmer all remain in the same farm, but the red player just does not score from that farm as he/she is outnumbered by the blue player.

Respuesta 2:

And on the situation of expanding and connecting cities.

Exactly the same. You never pick up a meeple until the feature is scored. If someone else (here, Red) manages to get into the city, you still outnumber him and he does not score.

IMO the game is mostly about trying to get into other players' cities, farms, and roads, to share points with everyone else, while not letting them share with you. :-)

Meeples never leave the board until the feature (city, road, cloister, farm) they are in is completed and scored. Since the farms are the last thing scored, farmers stay on the board until the end of the game.

Again, you get your knights back only when you complete the city they're in. So 2 blue kinghts and 1 red knight can stay in the same city, and if it's completed, only the blue knights will score. Not twice, but only once. The number just helps the players in gaining the majority in the city, not in scoring additional points.

Basically the same rule applies to roads and robbers.

I assume the first two questions relate to using the Tower.

1. The Builder is returned to the blue player.

2. The pig is returned to blue player.

3. No. Blue must have a pig of his own colour to score 4 points per city. He cannot use a pig of another player's colour as his own.

Tema 378: Joint decision???
Pregunta:
I hope that I'm not being too thick over this one, but can someone tell me why the rules state that when you pick up a tile, you, along with all the other players decide where to place it, cause surely they would tell you places that would benefit them instead of me. Or am I missing something?

Quote:
He looks at it shows it to his fellow players (so that they can advise him on the 'best' placement of the tile.
Thanks

Respuesta 1:
It's just the rules telling you that it's allowed to try and influence the other players so they will play their tiles in a place that will benefit (or not hurt) you. Note the apostrophes around 'best'.

EDIT: it's also a good way to give new players some advice on what their options are and what the consequences would be of placing a tile in a certain place, all without breaking any rules...

Respuesta 2:
That is correct. It is a 'tongue-in-cheek' rule that allows you to try and influence an opponents placement of a tile. My son takes great pleasure in 'advising' me on the best placement for my tile draw

Respuesta 3:
Keep in mind it is also a family game so they are trying to promote a social aspect of the game as well.

But the main points of the rule are that your tile is not secret until it is placed on the board; other players have the right to comment on it so table talk is allowed; and finally, nothing in the rules say you have to listen to any of them.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks great comments, cause I just felt that giving others ideas was almost like a chess game where Kasparov would say "that piece would look good there so that I can checkmate you in two moves". But I do see where you are all coming from on this, especially learners to the game. Thanks again.

Respuesta 5:
When my young grandson began joining the adults in playing this game, we gave him serious good advice about placement, along with the reasons. In a short time, he was beating us and advising us where to place our tiles. Now, my son (his uncle) tells us "please don't help him, he beats us without any help." So all of our table talk now is jocular in nature.

Respuesta 6:
As already stated, this one rule (aka suggestion) is what makes Carcassonne a social game... especially when you couple the tile placement suggestions with suggestions about finishing a huge city together to catch up with the current leader on the scoreboard, for example. Or using the "big" meeple to steal a city from another player (when playing with Inns & Cathedrals) or which way to move the dragon (Princess & Dragon) and so on and so on...

Respuesta 7:
Yes I never thought of that one, a sort of temporary alliance. Especially if the leader is way ahead of the rest of the field.



Tema 379: Meeple-Pig Thing
Pregunta:
How many points do I get for the pig meeple? The rules say that you get 5 points per completed city instead of 4.

Do they mean 4 instead of 3?

Respuesta 1:
It depends on which farm rules you are using. From your question, I would gather that you are using the latest farm rules. Either way, the pig just adds +1 point to the value of the cities.

Respuesta 2:
The pig meeple adds one point to the score each city the farm with a pig supplies. The confusion with the exact number of points is due to different rules. To the best of my knowledge (and I may be very wrong) the original rules were each city scored 4 points for the player who has the most farms supplying the city. The updated rules were that each farm scores 3 points for every city it supplies, thus more than one farm supplies each city. I am unaware of a change BACK to the 4 points per city rule, however, I haven't read much on Carc. in recent years, so I may be wrong.

Respuesta 3:
Jason Ackerman
@bwayjace

No, you are correct. Cities score 3 points.

What contributed to the confusion was that Rio Grande Games continued to ship with 1st edition rules (4 points) for many years after HiG put out the 3rd edition (3 point) rules. RGG recently began shipping with 3rd edition, so everyone is now on the same page.

Respuesta 4:
Bobby Warren
@Bobby4th

Versions of the farm rules differ in more than the magnitude of the score, but the old rules have been abandoned, and the base score is 3.

This is correct. (The pigherd adds another; base score is 3, unless barns get involved; x2 if the city has Cathar or Siege tiles.)



Tema 380: Just a quickie...
Pregunta:
When trying to decide who wins a city does the builder count as a Knight or not?

In other words, is the builder 'worth' anything or do we just ignore him?

Respuesta 1:
Builder is a special piece, and does not count as a follower. IIRC, the only pieces that count as followers for determining control are the regular meeples, big meeples, mayor, and the wagon. Anything else is just a special piece that may contribute to the score, but not the control.

Tema 382: Quick Road Question
Pregunta:
Hey All:

My wife and I just sat down to play our first game. If she lays a crossroads (a tile on which multiple roads meet) and puts a meeple there, does this mean I cannot place a meeple on ANY road that extends out from the crossroad? Confused...

Thanks,
John

Respuesta 1:
She has to choice only one road.


Edit: Choose

Respuesta 2:
You can't put a meeple on the same road where a meeple already exists. Crossroads are where roads END, so if she puts a meeple on one road on the crossroad, and you extend a different road, then you can meeple your extension.

Hope that helps!

Respuesta 3:
No. The crossroad tiles generally have a bush or something in the middle signifying that the various roads end there, thus there are 3 or 4 different roads pictured on the tile. Your wife can only claim one of the roads per turn. She has to choose one and place her meeple on that specific road. You may place another tile extending one of the other roads, place your meeple on that tile, and claim that road for yourself.



Tema 383: occupying cities
Pregunta:
When I first played Carcassonne the people I played with allowed any player to add to another player's city or road and place a follower on the tile just played, thus sharing the city or road and as the game progresses competing for it by trying to have the most followers on it when it is completed. I know that is not the correct way to play but what is wrong with that way? Does the game lose some tactical or strategic element? Does anybody else play this way?

Respuesta 1:
Yeah, you lose the strategy big time. If you can claim a portion of the city at any time, it just becomes a race to who can get the most in the city or who is lucky enough to close it at the right time.

In addition, anyone could try to jump in and get a share of the easy points by allowing others to do the work.

If you play by the rules, then it becomes more of a brain burner about being the most clever to connect your independent fragment(s) of the city so that you can join in and also have the majority. You then get into a situation where you can block by setting up impossible ways to connect.

The game is definitely more fun this way.

Respuesta 2:
Well, if everyone can share elements of the board, then, in theory, everyone would tie at the end of the game (provided everyone had enough meeples).

It certainly loses the strategic element of placing tiles that will eventually connect up with someone else's city (for example) and taking it over.

Seems to me it would really kill what makes the game fun.

This is exactly correct. We played the game incorrectly, by accident, for some time, and when we discovered our mistake and began playing by the rules, it became more fun for us. We still have lots of shared cities, roads, and fields, but only when players can find a way to connect their already-claimed parts. It is definitely a better game played by the actual rule on this.



Tema 384: River Rules Question
Pregunta:
When playing with the river, are the lake and the spring considered to be connected in all directions for the purposes of identifying a farm? If so, the first person to lay a tile has the option of laying a farmer on a farm that runs down both sides of the river until the first bridge crosses it - a bit of an advantage.

Thanks in advance for your enlightening responses!

Respuesta 1:
Yes, the farm does go around the spring and the lake and yes, the first player to lay a tile may place a farmer. Whether you consider this an advantage or not is a different discussion
The GQ11 expansion added a different spring tile to combat this 'problem'. We tend to use the GQ11 spring tile in our games.

See here: http://www.carcassonnecentral.com/forum/index.php?topic=170....

and here: http://www.carcassonnecentral.com/forum/index.php?topic=179....

Respuesta 2:
Advantage? To tie up a precious meeple for an entire game is questionable. It is not terribly difficult to fit a farmer into a field. It is also not terribly difficult for a farmer to find little or nothing in his/her field. There is no way to be sure at the start of a game that the investment will be worth it. I would be thrilled to see an opponent play a farmer on any river tile as that puts me up a man early in the game.

Maybe in a multi-person game it might make sense. However, the more expansions that are used, the less useful it would be because of how many more opportunities there are to score.

Consider placing a follower as an investment. It is also necessary to rotate them as judiciously as possible. That would be similar to making sure you are running cards through your hand in a card playing game.

My thoughts anyway......

Respuesta 3:
In our six-player games, we find it seldom to be advantageous to place a farmer during the placement of the river tiles. However, with six players, you can't wait too long to decide about placing farmers, as all the best fields will be taken. Near the end of the game, we are generally looking for one more good farmer location for those last few points.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks to all for the clarification. So far I've been playing the basic set with no expansions (other than the river, which came with it), and mostly two-player. I've found that getting at least one farmer out early can give you a leg up, even though it limits the number of followers you have to work with for the rest of the game. You do have to be careful to place them where they're not likely to get boxed in. but putting one on the first river piece after the spring, especially if it doesn't have a road crossing, gives that first farm a lot of possibilities for you to build cities adjacent to it, with most of the game ahead of you in which to do it.

In short, I see it as an advantage (although I can see the opposing point of view), and it's nice to know about the alternative spring tile. Forgive my ignorance: What's GQ11?

Respuesta 5:
GQ11 is a magazine Games Quarterly - don't think it is currently published.

They used to include the odd expansion in their magazine, usually for Settlers of Catan.

GQ Volume 11 included an expansion of 12 carc tiles. It was done about 2 to 3 years ago. I imagine you could pick up a copy somewhere on trade. It is not essential to get though, unless you are a "completist" and must have every expansion there is - for Carc this will set you back a hefty sum, and in my view isn't really that necessary. The basic game, plus Inns and Cathedrals is about all you need, and Traders and Builders might also be good to add too at some stage.

Respuesta 6:
Thanks again. I'm no Carc completist; I won't try to hunt that one down. On the other hand, I am interested in some of the other expansions, Inns & Cathedrals being highest on my list.

We always play with both River expansions, Inns and Cathedrals, and Traders and Builders. We do not score more for longest road or largest city. We also use all the additional tiles from Abbey and Mayor, but haven't cared much for the rest of the expansion. We did not like Princess and Dragon and have not been interested in any other expansions. We enjoy competition, but don't need the more nasty options.

Respuesta 8:
I've played a lot more since my original posting, and I have one or two observations in regards to this question:
In my experience, playing just the basic game, or (in particular) the basic game plus the river, getting a farmer out early can make a big difference. It does depend on how much river has been placed before the first road crossing. In one recent game, the three road crossings turned out to be the last three river tiles placed (before the lake), and we spent the whole game fighting over a huge farm that ended up supplying 13 cities.

In general though, the addition of expansions (I've tried Inns & Cathedrals, and Traders & Builders) reduces the value of farmers for two reasons:
- With more tiles, each follower is more precious. Tying up followers for the entire game is pretty risky.
- The new tiles included with the expansions tend to break up the map more than those in the basic set. Continuous open space is a little rarer, making for a smaller average farm size.

I still like to place one farmer early if a promising farm is available, but it's very rare that I'll go over two until the very late stages of the game. (The exception would be the gigantic farm like the one mentioned above, where it's clear that you need to be at least tied for followers on that farm to have a hope of winning the game.)

No you can't. The road already technically has a black thief on it and you are adding to that same road so you can't add another black thief to it. It works like any other situation with farming and building castles to where you can't just add another of your meeples to the same item unless they were originally two separate items and you were able to join them together in some fashion.

If you are adding to a road that has 2 black thieves and 1 red thief, no you can't add more meeples. The only way to add more meeples is to have a completely separate road that gets joined to that road. In this case with the 2 black thieves and the 1 red thief, black would get the points.

I've played this way, and what happened was... we had to reshuffle the tiles a couple of times, and it changed the gameplay, because playing this way, we know that 2 of the tiles we throwed out will be back on the table.
I personally have never played this way. We always draw just one tile versus three.

We use the pig differently from the builder. Once the pig is placed, it stays there for the duration of the game like the farmer does. We also play it such that the pig has to be played on a separate turn from the farmer and you must be farming the area to place the pig on that area as well.

I don't play this way either but I think you have it slightly wrong. I think the suggestion is to draw 3 tiles and KEEP the ones you don't play. On your turn, you draw a tile and play a tile. So you always have 3 to choose from in your hand. What might not be a good tile for you thise round could be the perfect one for you in a couple rounds.

But the point of this variant is to have more strategy and less luck. Drawing 3 and discarding 2 still keeps a heavy portion of luck with very little strategy.

But like I said, I don't play this way so maybe I am mistaken.

Your use of the word "still" suggests your questions were based on mistaken assumptions about what happens if there is only one thief already on a road. While Tim Collett's answer clearly addresses the examples you gave, I think the following points need to be made clear:

If you place a tile so as to extend a road that already has a thief of your own color, you cannot put a thief on that road.

If you place a tile so as to extend a road that already has a thief of somebody else's color, you cannot put a thief on that road.

1A) When I play a tile that will connect a road with a black thief and a road with a red thief, can I still put my black thief on it and create an advantage of 2 black thieves against 1 red?
There are two good reasons why you can't. The first good reason why you can't is the existing black thief; the second is the existing red thief; each individually prevents you from putting a thief there. If you place a tile that will connect two existing roads, the only time you can put a thief on that connecting piece of road is if neither or the two existing pieces of road already has any thief at all on it.



Tema 386: Quick Carc Question
Pregunta:
Hello everyone (or at least those of you who are looking at this question). Man have I caught this gaming bug something fierce! Having spent countless hours scouring the Geek forums for recommendations and the hard-won wisdom of you veteran gamers, I reckon it's about time to cash in the ol' anonymity and get involved. Anyway, here's a question about Carcassonne that, having never arisen before in our sessions, came up today during two consecutive games...

If, upon your tile lay, you complete a move (city,road,cloister) for your opponent, does your opponent retrieve his meeple and score those points in that completed area before or after his/her next tile lay?

The only time this would really matter, I suppose, would be when your opponent has no meeples left to play except the meeple you've just freed for them; as was the case both times we encountered this scenario this evening. So I guess the question could be more succinctly put thus:

Is an opponent's meeple that you have liberated available for his/her use at the beginning of your opponent's next turn?

Or, even more simply:

If you free an opponent's meeple, when do they pick it up?

Phew!
Thanks in advance for your answers, and thanks for the engaging, helpful and respectful forums!

Since you reposted the question, I'll repost the answer....

Tema 387: Farmers scoring rules
Pregunta:
I have a doubt about the farmers scoring rules in the game.

How does it score? 'Per farm' or 'per city'?

I explain myself. Imagine a case of a city, surrounded by two farms. In one farm there is a blue farmer. In the other, a blue and a red farmer.

If counting 'per farm', blue scores 3 for one farm, and the other farm counts 3 for each player, as they are tied. In summary, 6 for blue, 3 for red.

If counting 'per city', a city only scores ONCE. So we sum ALL farmers in ALL surroundong farms. This totals 2 blue farmers, one red farmer, so blue scores 3 and red scores 0.

In the rules I have received in the game box, I have read it it counts 'per city'(summing all farmers in all farms), but in the example images they score 'per farm', with the particularity that each player only can score ONCE per city (if the player owns more than one farm for a city, only scores once, so, in our example it would be 3 for blue, 3 for red).

It's VERY confusing.

Thanks!

P.D.: In case that you can choose to use any of both scoring rules ('per city' or 'per farm'), wich one do you think is more interesting for a two players game? Thanks again!

Respuesta 1:
There are two editions of scoring - 1st and 3rd. Officially, everyone is on 3rd edition at this point though many North American players might still be using 1st edition since Rio Grande just recently switched over to 3rd edition.

I prefer 3rd edition because it makes the most sense to me and is what the expansions were using when created. So there are less rule conflicts and trying to convert whatever is being scored.

So with 3rd edition, you score farm by farm. Determine majority in each farm (we remove excess meeples) and then give that player (or players if tied on the meeple count) 3 points for every boardering city that is completed (and potential additional points if you are using expansions). Once we score a farm, we remove the balance of those meeples. So when all the meeples are gone, all the scoring is done.

There were *three* editions with dfferent scoring. Sounds like you have a copy of the 2nd HiG edition. These rules were only used for a short time, and the 'city can only score once per player' part was removed shortly after in the 3rd edition.

Respuesta 3:
brian
@ColtsFan76

Agreed. In 3rd, you score from the meeple (just like you do for every other feature) rather from the city.

Respuesta 4:
Both ways work but the 'old' Rio Grande rules seem more confusing to some players. There is nothing really wrong with the 'old' rules (scoring once per city) and some players feel it requires more skill. Unfortunately the old RG scoring doesn't work well once the expansions are added to the game, particularly the more recent ones.

When I play using the old RG scoring I mark each completed city with a large bead during tile play then during the end game use the beads as a visual and tabulating scoring aid. The beads are collected up as each city is scored. Seems to help new players understand the scoring. In that system each city only counts once for four points, the player(s) with the majority farmers around the/each city score. The number of farmers matter not farms. Farms only limit the placement of the farmer meeples during tile play. I only use this system when playing with the base game.

The new or 3rd edition scoring uses farms as the scoring base. Each farm gets 3 points for each completed city next to it. Control of each farm is determined by who has the most farmers. Thus each completed city can be scored multiple times, by each adjacent farm. Also small two tile cities score for the full 4 points plus 2 per pendant, not the 2 points as in the Rio Grande rules. Each farm feels more like a city in it's scoring.

Personally I used to like the 'per city' scoring in a two player game but all my recent games now use the 'per farm' scoring. It just works better with the expansions. Plus it has the added advantage of confusing opponents used to the 'old' system

Respuesta 5:
Agree with everything thats been said.

I prefer "per farm" scoring because that is consistent with the way that all other features are scored - decide who has the majority on that feature and then give 'em the points.

Farms can be confusing enough for new players without having to say, "right, now farms are scored differently to everything else..."

I have the 1st edition rules and have been playing farms as described therein. I've been thinking I like the 3rd edition better, though, and am likely to shift to those rules in my next games. I wasn't aware, however, that in the 3rd edition rules that 2 tile cities score full points. Is this the generally accepted scoring method for 2 tile cities by the majority of players now?

There has never been a variation that would have given blue 3 and red 0. In the 1st edition rules, which were 'per city', the basic value was 4 not 3 (in your example, 4 for blue, 0 for red). (The 2nd edition rules, which first reduced the farm value to 3, 'per farm' except that a player could not score farmers on the same city twice.)



Tema 388: All my meeples are in play, but I complete a city without a knight in it...
Pregunta:
All my meeples are in play, but I complete a city without a knight in it, do I still score points for that city?

I was going through the rule sheet and it didn't really clarify that point. Or maybe I misunderstood it.

Respuesta 1:
If you don't have any meeples in the city, you don't get any points. However, if someone else's meeples are in the city, they will get the points from you finishing their city.

Geoff

Respuesta 2:
...er, NO. Nor does anyone else score who doesn't have a knight in the completed city. Thats the whole point of knights, to get points when the city, they are in, is completed (or at games end).

Of course at the games end you could score points for the city by supplying it with farm(s).

Or if you have certain expansions, like the Count of Carcassonne, you might get some advantage for completing a city you don't score.

Understandable enough. The formality of placing a knight that's only going to be taken up again immediately is often skipped. But of course it becomes important if you don't have a worker available in the first place.

Respuesta 5:
Being the person to play the tile to close a city is relevant to some expansion mechanisms (claiming trade goods from Traders and Builders, claiming the King from King & Scout)... but for normal scoring, the city scores when completed regardless who completes it, and scores for the player that has the most knights (minimum one) present (and scores the full amount for all tied-for-most players when multiple players are tied-for-most).



Tema 389: RioGrande Games adopts 3rd ed ruleset

They really should have done that earlier and missed an opportunity with the first Big Box, before the release of Abbey & Mayor.

That is probably the reason for the change in the basic game now.



Tema 390: 1st, 2nd, 3rd Rules question?? And Whats on BSW??
Pregunta:
I bought Carcassonne not long ago and before I bought it I kept hearing that it came with first edition rules but my rules clearly show that a 2 tile city is worth 4 points and from my understanding that is a 3rd edition rule.. Is this correct??

And if so then why when I play on BSW and I dont select the old option(and I think that is for the 1st edition rules) am I only getting 2 points for a 2 tile city..... I didnt notice it until I was playing with the I&C expansion so not sure if it does the same thing without it....

And does anyone have a good link showing the differnces between the 3 versions so I can figure out what I am playing with? Thanks in advance for any help....

Respuesta 1:
I can't help you with BSW.

However, no one uses 2nd edition rules and I am not really sure what those incorporate. I think they keep the first edition 2-tile city scoring at 2 points but use the 3rd edition farm points. So it sounds like BSW might be using 2nd edition.

More so than the 2-tile cities, the big difference is between how farms are scored. 1st edition: Each city scores 4 points for have the majority of farmers in the adcjacent farms (after determining control of each farm). 3rd Edition: Each farm (after determining control) scores 3 points for each adjacent city.

How farm scoring is handled will tell you what edition you have.

Quote:

A city with only two tiles would score four points during the game with knights in the 3rd edition. Three points for every adjecent city in a farm in the endgame.

BrettspielWelt is using the 2nd edition rules. Carcassonne's BSW rulebook

The 2nd edition is like the 3rd, except that knights on two tile cities score two points and players can only score cities once for farming points.

There's a decent summary of the rule differences on Wikipedia.

Tema 393: Complete Turn Summary Covering All Expansions
Pregunta:
I've started a long overdue update to my complete Carcassonne turn summary. As with my previous versions, this one is a synthesis of everything available from HiG, the official FAQ, Matt Harper's questions and notes, and discussions here on BGG, tempered by my own judgment about what works where there are disputes or remaining uncertainties.

This version covers all expansions (even the catapult) and, as with all previous summaries, is based on the "3rd Edition" rules, which are now universally "official".

The big change with this version is that I've re-implemented it as a dynamic web page, so that you can generate rules tailored to the specific expansions you are playing with. Since it is no longer a simple static document, an introduction is in order:

The page is divided into sections which can be expanded and collapsed as is convenient. An introductory section describes how to set up the game.


This section can be collapsed once the game is set up.

The next section describes the turn structure.


Remaining sections cover game end and scoring.



There's also a header section, collapsed by default, that can be expanded to see information about the current version and expansions in use.


The neat new feature of this version is that it is customizable to the set of expansions you're using. To support this there is also a "Settings" section, that can be expanded to expose some controls for configuring the page to your liking.


The use of these controls should be pretty straightforward and can be figured out by experimenting (you can always revert to the default settings by reloading the page). I recommend turning "Expansion Colors" on, as it makes it easier to get a sense of how different expansions change the rules.


The rules displayed change in response to changes made with the settings controls,


and the information on what rules are in use is summarized in the header as well



As with previous versions of my summary, the concise approach I take relies on getting some definitions straight. These are generally defined in popups that appear when you hover with your mouse pointer over relevant words in the text:



Let me know (here in this thread) if you find any bugs in the rules or in the way the page behaves. (Note that I'm not looking for suggestions on additional features: I already have a very long list of things I'm not going to get to.)

This page should work fine on most browsers and platforms, with the notable exception of IE (for reasons I shouldn't have to explain).

Enjoy!

This is neat, and obviously took quite a while to work out. You'd have if I hadn't used the last of mine to get an avatar.

But, I've noticed that the scoring section is mildly confusing; incomplete roads with inns and incomplete cities with cathedrals are shown as scoring negative points at the end of the game. I see that it's to counter the points that would have been scored if the inn/cathedral wasn't present but missed that initially. I figure people could easily read it as losing points without having added the prior points.
I would suggest changing things so that the addition of Inns & Cathedrals changes the wording to "if city contains Cathedral" and "if city doesn't contain Cathedral" and similar for roads.

You've also put the "to majority players" notice on the cloisters/abbey which might confuse people as there is always going to be a single player (or no player) having a piece there, never more than one.

I tried various methods of capturing scoring in a way that was uniform across all expansions and features, and that also emphasized the effects of expansion elements, and settled on this one, even though it differs a bit from the way it's presented in the rules as written.

For fun, here's what what scoring looks like if you use all the expansions:

Good call, but: If you play with The Count, then a farmer could have been transferred to a field with a barn immediately before final scoring. Then if you follow the table above, you'll get the right result. Technically, the resulting scoring is not "final scoring"; but that's a distinction without a difference, which I've opted to eliminate by adding the "no barn present" line to the table, rather than adding a new scoring and farmer removal step between farmer transfer and final scoring.

Tema 394: Can you score with a piece twice in the same turn?
Pregunta:
Placing happens before scoring. So, in your example, you could not place, score, retrieve, and then place again. You played it right.

Respuesta 1:
Only one meeple per tile and you must have a meeple in order to place a meeple. Mepples must be placed on the tile laid.

Place tile - then add meeple - then score and retrieve meeples

But it is possible to score twice on a single tile if you complete two different structure that you own by placing the tile and have a mepple on at least one of the structure previously, so you can put a meeple on the tile you just laid.

Respuesta 2:
If you're using the builder expansion then yes, because you could have two turns consecutively.
1. place tile that extends the feature with the builder on it to get another go - ensure this also completes something with a meeple on it.
2. You can't place a meeple cos you don't have any at this point
3. Score the completed feature
4. retreive meeple(s)
5. Place tile 2 and deploy a meeple on that 2nd tile (this could be the builder or a follower, depending upon what you retreived).

This is the only way I can think of that you could kind of do a scoring action and then place a meeple afterwards, but really, it's 2 seperate turns by the same player!

Otherwise, the normal rules follow 1-4 above,
1. place tile
2. place meeple
3. score
4. retreive meeple
If you are out of meeples, you can't place one in stage 2, you'll get one back later on if you score and retrieve meeples.

I always thought with the builder that, if your feature is completed with the first tile you draw, then you don't get the second turn to place another tile? My girlfriend and I play it that way, anyway...

Respuesta 4:
The rules I've got show a pictorial chain of events with the builder meeple being removed from a road and then placed within a city as part of two consecutive tile placements by the same player. I can't refer to them from here at work, but I'm pretty sure that's correct.

That's correct.

From my turn summary:

Quote:
After scoring a feature, all figures in that feature are returned to their owners. If the just-placed tile extended or completed a feature that contained the placing player’s builder, the player must take one complete additional turn.
Note that the additional turn is no different from any other turn, and that the player just takes one additional turn (the process doesn't repeat).



Tema 395: A simple question........Carcassonne......regarding stealing a city
Pregunta:
Can someone please clarify if this is a legitimate move in Carcassonne, we are playing the basic game with no expansions.

If my opponent is developing a city with one follower (meeple) on for example, can i then place an adjoining city tile and put one of my own followers on and therefore share spoils, also if we carry on developing the city with one follower each, can i then hang around and then finish the city with one 'completing' tile and place a second follower on this last tile therefore stealing all the points ?

This is how we have been playing and my girlfriend thinks it may be wrong because i end up stealing all her points, maybe thats just how it should be played ha ha !

Any help would be cool...ta

Respuesta 1:
You can steal cities absolutely. However when you place a meeple in a city that city tile cannot be attached to a city with another meeple already in it.

So for example you can place a city tile that doesn't join to another controlled city and place a meeple and then join them together with another piece....But you can't just add another tile to a city and stick a guy in there.

Respuesta 2:
Just to clarify HamsterOfFury's reponse in relation to your descriptions

Not like this.

@Ghostdriver

You can't do this either.

You must start another city (with a city tile and a follower) near to the 'target' city, but not directly connected to it. Then, in a later turn, you can place a tile that connects the 'target' city and your new city together. That would share the city. In order to win the city points (not share them), you would have to perform this process again, to get a second follower into the city.

The basic rule is: you can only put a follower down on a city/road/farm feature if there isn't already a follower controlling that feature.

Bringing this thread back from the dead to ask for a little clarification on this point. Does this still apply if you are adding to a feature (city, road, farm) that has only your followers on it?

Example: There is an incomplete, 5-tile city in the works with one of my followers on it - there are no other followers in the city. I add a 6th tile which connects to the other 5 directly - can I add another follower? Or would I have to work another of my own follwers into this city?

No, you cannot. A follower can never be placed on a feature that's already connected to another follower, your own or an opponent's.

Tema 397: Does a Completed City with a hole in it score?
Pregunta:
I have been playing Carcassonne for about two years now, and tonight was introducing it to a friend for the first time. I briefly explained the rules, and half way thru the game, he asked "Can completed cities have 'holes?".

I have never thought or experienced a city with a completed wall but with a missing middle tile piece. Yet in two tiles time, we had our first one.

My guess is that it satisfies the criteria for a completed city (you just don't get points for missing internal tiles), but would be grateful for your thoughts / confirmation.

cheers.

Respuesta 1:
If it has a hole, then it is not complete.yet. Remember that tiles may even split up that "completed" city into up to 4 different cities if all 4 sides have city ends.

Respuesta 2:
Complete as in both outer and inner walls complete?

e.g.

----------
- -
- ---- -
- -GG- -
- -GG- -
- ---- -
- -
----------

Where lines are walls are G is a green area for a farmer?

Or did you mean that only the outer wall had been completed and the middle green area was missing?

In the first case the city is complete.

If the 'inner wall' in my second example is not there then no it does not count as complete.

Hope this is clear.

Well, then your view is apparently wrong Actually, I suggest you carefully re-read the rules and verify that you're recalling rules correctly, because I really doubt anyone would waste words to say the same thing ("completely surrounded by a wall" and "there should be no gaps in the wall") twice Too bad I don't have English version, so I can't verify the exact wording, but the edition in my language clearly states that (translation) "a city is complete if it is completely surrounded by the wall and there are no gaps in the city".

I can confirm my eyes and reading skills are adequate, and it says exactly what I stated. I note from the Rio Grande Games web site they have revised rules which now state that "A city is complete when the city is surrounded by a city wall with no gaps in the wall nor holes in the city". So, I am guessing after read a few threads, I have the 1st edition rules, and the web / lastest version is the 3rd edition rules which added the no holes text for clarification.

So ... as a pedantic, if I am playing 1st edition rules (ie the rules that came in the box), this seems to mean I can have gaps / missing tiles inside a completely closed walled city.

Respuesta 15:
I have the original version 1.0 of the rules:

"A city is complete when the city is completely surrounded by a city wall there are no gaps in the wall"

So according to a strict interpretation of the original rules, the "not completed" city would have been considered to be completed.

I personally would never have interpreted the rule this way, but since another interpretation is viable, a clarification was needed.

==============================================

This rule was clarified in version 3.0:

"A city is completed when its segments are fully encompassed by a city wall and there are no gaps within the city."

So according to the most up-to-date rules, the "not completed" city is not completed.

We can play the game of 'my version rules say...' all day. Plain and simple, this is a no-brainer. If the city has a hole in it as described, it is incomplete. Do you really need rules to look at that gaping hole in the center of your town to know it's just shy of being completed?

Just to extrapolate on "how would it play out if it were played that way..."

Suppose the center-gap city were considered complete on the completion of the outer wall. The meeple(s) in the city would be retrieved and the city would score. Then, what if someone played a tile to the center gap? What if they wanted to play a meeple on that tile? Would the city be counted as 'completed again' and thus scored again? Would the meeple be stranded forever?

Well - - in the game I played, the single all city-sided tile had already been placed. And I guess completion of a city would be defined by the wall, not by tiles within the city, so you would not be able to play a tile in the middle given the wall is now completed (and the city is hence well fortified).

And common sense is a relative concept. The game theme at the beginning of the rules talks about Carcassonne being famous for its unique fortifications, not for its tiled floors. The game was inspired by walls, not floors.

Anyway - - I think I have added enough burley to the discussion; Im off to create my new Carcassonne expansion: Sinkholes & Mine Collapse.

Respuesta 19:
David, there is no rule forbidding you to place a tile anywhere it fits. So, I AM allowed to place a tile in the center of your "completed" city and score again. And this is bullshit. No feature in Carcassonne can ever be scored again - so why stick to incomplete rules? Just "to be right anyway"?

Consider this scenario:

Look at this tile: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/115467, row 5, column 1 (the "D" like city tile). Take four of them. Rotate the tiles by 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° and form a cross with a whole in it. Imagine these tiles were connected with each other during the game according to the rules. This should look like this now:


 /\
/GG\
\GG/
 \/


The "G" area is a real gap. According to David's ruling this city needs to be considered completed as to 1st edition ruling. I say bullshit. This city is NOT completed, even more it's NOT CLEAR that this is even ONE city. Fill the gap with the follwing piece: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/115468, row 1, column 3 (the tile with the four "D" like cities on it)

We now have FOUR seperate cities!

Does this convince you that the ruling is plain wrong?

Respuesta 20:
The answer is surely NO for two clear reasons:
1) According to rules v.3, there can be NO GAPS ON THE CITY.
2) How is it possible to have A COMPLETED WALL WITH GAPS? If it's completed it has no gaps. Otherwise it's not completed.

Even if your rules said:

"A city is complete when the city is completely surrounded by a city wall there are no gaps in the wall"

having a complete outer wall and a gap in the middle (as Evan's large pictured example above, right side, labelled "Not Completed" does) it does not meet this ruling criteria. This rule says "...when the city is completely surrounded..." not "...when a gap is completely surrounded..." and since your example isn't wall surrounding a city, it isn't a complete city.

You can't do an immediate U-Turn because the ties may not match up and you would have no legal placements. If there is a space between your U-Turn, then the river can double-back without the tiles being adjacent.

Respuesta 6:
Basically, the spirit of the U-turn prohibition is that you shouldn't place a river tile that would prevent future river tiles from being placed in such a way that they extend the river.

So, as brian says, if the river makes a U-turn, it needs to do so with at least one straight tile between the 90 turn tiles; otherwise you might not be able to place the next river tile drawn.

Respuesta 7:
I agree with Brian. However, some people play that the river may only travel in two directions for its entire run. For example, the river may only go South and West, never North or East.

It's also how the farmers score that's different. Instead of counting farmers per city, it's now farmers per field. The winner gets the points for all cities touching that field. (Therefore, a city may score more than once!)

I prefer those 3rd edition farming rules, it keeps the farmers balanced while making them much easier to score. I'm not a fan of the 2-tile, 4-point castle rule though, so I keep it at 2 points.

This is the critical point. The 3rd Edition rules score fields just like all other features: points go to the players with the most followers in the feature. (Remove followers, score next.)
Except of course the fields (3rd edition) are not scored like cities or roads. If they were, then some points based on the fields themselves (their size or their contents) would be awarded to the owner(s) of the most farmers within each. Instead, points based on the number of cities around the fields are awarded. The point producing element is outside of the feature being scored. (This could be viewed as more in line with the monasteries, but there the outside elements scored are always directly adjacent and never subject to a long chain of connections possibly created much later.) And a city can score for more than one farmer.

One could just as easily make the case that, viewed from a city instead of a field perspective, farmer scoring in the 1st edition is just like all the other features - you are scoring for each city and you determine a "most" based of the farmers around each city. The difference being that the farmers are outside of the element they score for (each city) rather than within. (This could be viewed as more in line with the monasteries, where often 8 of the 9 tiles that are scored have the monk on a feature outside of them.) And a farmer can score for more than one city.

Either view can be argued to be more logical - do farmers score for fields but determine their points based on cities, or do farmers score for cities but determine their influence based on connections through fields? And of course farmers are always unlike the other meeples in that they get stuck for the game, they don't worry about whether the element they are placed in is completed, but they do care about whether the city they score for is completed.

I like the idea that every terrain element is scored differently - roads are 1-D and score the same complete or not, cities are 2-D and get the shields and complete or not actually matters, monasteries have a fixed upper limit but must be claimed when placed with no way to horn in later, and fields are subject to all the content from the preceding paragraphs depending on edition of the rules you use.

In the long run, which you prefer is up to you. The 3rd edition supporters claim that all the expansions were designed with those rules in mind, and therefore the expansions must play better with the rules they were designed to match - but that hasn't been my experience. I think Inns and Cathedrals plays better with 1st edition scoring, Traders and Builders is a toss up, Princess and Dragon better with 1st, Tower slightly better with 3rd, and Abbey and Major much better with 3rd. Since my playgroup doesn't much like Tower or A&M they have reverted to 1st edition field scoring.

It also depends on the style of play of your group. I've seen a lot of comments that 3rd edition rules are much more exciting because you don't get the owner of one big field with two meeples in it getting all the final points. Even someone who takes a smaller field with only one meeple gets some points for the few completed cities it connects to. But when I watch people who are devoted to 1st edition, they usually don't end up with one big field - and there is a lot of excitement in the final stages as meeples are plopped into farms on the other side of the outer completed cities, not just to get some points also, but to transfer control of the city to a different player, getting points and denying them to someone else.

Also, I think the whole issue of which is the simpler scoring is just smoke. It seems some people find one more intuitive while others favor the other view. I've never had a problem with either. (But if I play 1st edition, then we put a penny on each completed city at the end of the game. Move from penny to penny, seeing who has the most farmers that can travel to it to deliver goods, award points and remove the penny.)

So pick which farmer scoring you like.

On the 2-tile city I think it matters what expansions you are using. Hunters and Gatherers has its own mechanism to encourage larger forests (the city equivalent). Later expansions for the base game also provide some of these. If you are playing with only the base and I&C, then you would probably want to keep the 2-point special rule. I tend to think (for many reasons) that a design goal was to encourage but not demand larger cities. But as the game added expansions and became more and more complex, then the minimal incentive provided by having an entire special case was viewed as not warranted. This often happens in game design - there is a nice element, somewhat interesting and unique, and there really aren't any problems with it, but it just doesn't provide enough interest to warrant the amount of room in the rule book and in the players' cognitive space to keep it as part of the game. If you are all already ingrained with the 2-point rule, I see no reason to give it up.

Your view seems to be based on the idea that "score" is related to the feature that the follower is placed on. Farmers score the field, which then is valued at three points per touching completed city. Starting from that view, I would agree that a shared mechanism (in 3rd edition) is that you can first determine ownership of the road, city, or field, and then go on to determine the appropriate rewards. I would still contend that fields are not scored like cities or roads because the last two score for elements which are part of the feature, while fields score for something which is external to the feature. But that matters little. The important thing here is that the consistency is based on "followers in the feature" and "farmers score fields" concepts.

A view I find just as easy to justify, is that "score" is related to the feature that provides the actual numeric value. At the end of the game, farmers score the completed "cities" (not fields), even though they happen to be placed in the fields around them. During the game - completed cities, roads, and monestaries score once based on the total meeple influence of each player on each object being scored. You get a shared mechanism (in 1st edition) when, during the end of game farmer scoring, completed cities are scored once with the value awarded to the most farmeeple influence. I would still contend that farmer scoring is unlike that of knights and thiefs, because the meeples are positioned outside the feature (city) being scored, and that means there isn't a convenient built-in object to remove from each city as it is scored, which is why we used the pennies. But that matters little. The important thing in this view is that the consistency is based on "the feature that provides the points" and "farmers score cities" concepts.

But attempts to find consistency are less interesting to me than the differences of the various meeple roles. I think understanding the differences, and how they encourage different types of play behaviors, makes comparing roles more interesting and makes comparing the different Carcassonne flavors (Base, H&G, City, Ark, etc.) more interesting.

BTW: I play either 1st or 3rd as appropriate to the play group. I lean toward the second view above, probably as a result of the fact that the initial rules I encountered described scoring for farmers, not for fields - and in fact said "farms are not scored, they exist only as places to deploy farmers" (in English translation). And I have retained a "meeple centric" rather than "feature centric" view from that early bias. I don't see a correlation between which view you favor and which rule set you prefer. Above, Eric uses "how the farmers score" while Aldaron uses "score fields" (and both favor 3rd), and I focus on the word "field" only in my initial reply to Aldaron and then shift to the (more natural for me) "farmer scoring" terminology (and find value, and different tensions, in both 1st and 3rd).

To Kevin:

I should have been more precise in my previous response. If you were wondering about "official" just because you like to stay current - then my advice of "go with what you like" is still valid. If you are planning on playing in a tournament, you probably want to ask first. If "official" means "as in the printed rules" then there has been divergence between the changing German versions (1st, 2nd - avoid, and 3rd) and the English version (which stayed with the equivalent of German 1st). Jay (American publisher) may prefer the 1st edition rules, or he may have stayed with them because he prefers one rule-set over the confusion of a different one with every printing. I have yet to see the rule-set shipping in the new 29.95 boxes, and he may have finally changed horses - so what you define as "official" may be up to you.

I didn't miss your point - I just didn't agree with it.
I think you disagree with some points I wasn't making (but which are often made along with mine: about which ruleset is better, which is official, which is more natural, which is more interesting, etc.). My point is the same one that ColtsFan76 was making.

Respuesta 12:
I find neither ruleset better (just different), official is usually subject to debate (especially if the designer intends something, one or more publishers decide differently, and if there are different rules in different languages), neither are natural and both are equally arbitrary (if you mean which mechanic matches the real-life activity), and both are interesting in different ways. If those views are different than yours, then yes I disagree with points you weren't making - but that was certainly not my intent in my response.

My initial response was to provide the original poster with an alternative view to your rather absolutist "The 3rd Edition rules score fields just like all other features" because I feel that statement is incorrect. I value the differences, so I would be unwilling to ignore things like the "stuck until end of game" concept - which for me is the biggest difference regardless of ruleset. Also, I've carefully read multiple base and expansion text versions (German and English) and believe (even under 3rd edition) that one scores farmers not fields, and that farmers score for completed cities. (I suspect we also disagree on farmers vs. fields, because you initially responded to a sentence about "It's how farmers score that's different" with a statement about "field" scoring.)

My follow-up response was for two purposes.

One was to clarify that I actually hadn't missed your point. Around here, one never knows if that concern is genuine - or if it is some sort of blanket dismissal on the level of "oh, her ideas are crazy" or "he's just stupid". I'm not certain why it is now fashionable to assume that if someone doesn't agree, that they must have missed the point, be insane, or have faulty brain operation - but it is a well-documented trend. I still feel discussion forums are for discussing and possible learning, rather than winning - and I still allow people to arrive with different experiences, premises, and views - and acknowledge that what you consider logically consistent can differ based on your view.

The second purpose was to clarify for the original poster that what I had previously suggested needed to be filtered and applied differently depending on why he was asking about "actually official". (I always believe one should think for oneself before adopting a suggestion, but I do consider it a disservice if I don't point out the context of my suggestions.) And to provide him with a little history of the changes, so he wouldn't have to read a lot of other posts to understand how we arrived here.


My reason for this follow-up is also two-fold

One reason is to mention all of the above for the benefit of Aldaron and any other interested reader. I'm not certain what point ColtsFan76 was trying to get across. His formula ("Meeple scores X points per some feature") is just as applicable to 1st ("Farmers score 4 point per completed adjacent city) as 3rd. Is he supporting a "focus on the meeple not the feature" view, or trying to redirect Aldaron's discussion from fields to cities? Aldaron probably knows more about Brian's thinking from other discussions. I decided not to comment on Brian's response because the oversimplified equation doesn't mention "meeple influence" and it isn't the 3 vs. 4 points that would be informative to the original poster, but rather the change to the way influence is calculated.

To Kevin:

The second reason is to update the above history with the current news. It does seem that Jay (American publisher) has updated the latest rules to reflect the current rules (3rd edition) used by the German publisher. I had suspected and hoped that this would be the case. (I have yet to see a copy or a scan for myself, but see no reason to doubt the news.) So now it is up to you to decide what is "official" - which for some is "whatever is written down that came inside the box I bought", though I suspect you don't fall into that camp or you wouldn't be asking here. If you shift to 3rd edition, this should make integration of the later (and future) expansions easier - but make sure you understand the change to how influence is calculated. If you stick with 1st, then you may want to expand only with Inn & Cathedrals. (I think Traders & Builders works fine with 1st as well, though it isn't one of my favorite expansions, and it does mean the pig plays slightly different.) Also, if you do stick with 1st you will have lots of company - those who simply don't want to change along with those who define "official" as "original" rules or "original preferred by designer" rules.

My friends with kids in Florida will be sticking with 1st, as they have only the 1st (I&C) expansion - and that mostly for 6-player support. I'm certain my local opinionated playgroup will stick with 1st. The couple with whom I regularly have dinner and a game - will probably go with 3rd, in part because I am guilty of giving them Abbey and Mayor. So things won't be consistent for me. If you don't mind shifting gears, you can go that route as well.

I'll point out when I disagree with Aldaron if he makes a statement like one version is innately more logical or consistent than the other. I'll also point out the absurdity of an argument that some mechanism must "play better" with a specific ruleset, merely because that is the ruleset it was designed to be played under - the two concepts are not necessarily correlated. As I said above, I&C seems to play better with 1st edition rules, but that may not be a true counter example as it may, despite some very vocal claims to the contrary, have been completely designed and finalized prior to the rules change. What you should hope is that there wouldn't be problematic rules conflicts under the matching rules sets. (See Abbey & Mayor, which is just weird with 1st edition rules.)

But I will agree with Aldaron that 3rd edition is the preferred one based on integration with all the existing expansions. (At least that is his view as usually expressed elsewhere - but he can chime in if I am unfairly speaking for him.) Note that I still don't say "better", just preferred. I still find the way cities (under 3rd) can score twice (or more) for the same player to be a detractor to the elegance of the game - a sentiment the designer seems to have shared - but the first farmer scoring change (2nd), which did account for that fine point, was nearly unplayable.

The point I am trying to make is that 3rd edition brings farmers into the same formula as the rest of the features. A meeple dictates which areas are scored and the points are accumulated by a set number of features.

Just like a meeple is removed when a city, a road, or a cloister is scored, a meeple is now removed when a farm is scored. Visual progress can be seen as farms are scored and meeples removed. I have found it easier to explain farms in this way as there is a connection to the other features, thus the illustration of my "oversimplified" formula.

In 1st edition, farmers do NOT follow this pattern. It is not the single (after majority calculated) meeple driving the farm scoring but the cities themselves gathering the points. And because multiple farms can influence multiple cities, the meeples must remain in place until the very end to make sure nothing was overlooked. It is also more difficult to keep track of - especially if you are using lots of expansions and have a large playing area - what has been scored and what hasn't. (Some people suggest using pennies - but this introduces something not in the game).

Anyway, 1st edition does not fall into my "oversimplified" equation. To take a stab at it, it would look something like this:

Cities score 4 points to the player with the most influence in each adjacent farm.
Knights score 2 points per city tile and banner (if completed).
Thieves score 1 point per road tile.
Monks score 1 point per tile adjacent to and including the cloister.

It does NOT follow the pattern of Meeple scores X points for Y components.

Arguing what is "more official" is pointless as 3rd edition is official across all meepledom now. Arguing which is better is still a matter of opinion. But stating that all of the expansions have been designed with 3rd edition as the base set is matter of fact (with maybe the exception of IC and possibly TB - I am not sure when the switch occured). But the more expansions that came out, the more issues it caused for Jay to stick with 1st edition rules. He had to continually rewrite the rules and force the new features to work with 1st edition farms. AM put the final nail in the coffin as the barns were incompatible with 1st edition farms. At that point, Jay gave up and directly (to the best of my knowledge) translated the rules. And since that time, he has adopted 3rd edition rules.

Respuesta 14:
I'm sorry Brian; I didn't mean "oversimplified" in a disparaging manner. I meant that, as simplified, it would more likely convey the idea that each meeple would gather points for features - not that the player with the most meeples related to the feature would gather the points. And the topic by that point (to me) was not the 3/4 issue but the manner of determining influence. Also, it is simplified in city scoring in that it does not mention the difference between completed city and incomplete city scoring. I assumed the simplification was introducing an inaccuracy (as it usually does in any technical or logical examination) that you found not relevant to the discussion, but which was making it difficult for me to discern your point.

I will gladly agree with you, when you focus on the removal of farmers as scoring occurs, as a place where both 2nd and 3rd edition made farmers more like other meeples. To almost quote you "1st edition farmers do NOT follow that pattern" at all. I think this is a distinct advantage of 3rd edition. But I didn't discern that part of the pattern in the stated version of your formula.

In discussing 1st edition, you said "It is not the single meeple driving the farm scoring but the cities themselves gathering the points". In cities (in any edition), it isn't the single meeple driving the city scoring - it is having the most knight influence on the city that allows the knights to gather the points. We don't think of it as the cities somehow gathering the points. Why would it be different for 1st edition farmers? If you have the most farmer influence on the city then that allows the farmers to gather the points. Why in that one case would you shift the emphasis to the feature rather than the meeple?

What I think is clear is that the shift from 1st edition to 3rd has shifted farmers from being attached to cities to being attached to farms (which curiously is defined as a field with a farmer in it, while a city is a city regardless of occupancy). From that, I could go with a formula like "A 'most' of Meeples associated with a feature X, scores Y points per item in elements list Z" where the list can be both tiles and banners, both monastery and directly adjacent tiles, or all adjacent completed cities.

That resolves as

During game completed element scoring

- A most of Thieves on a road, scores 1 point per road tile.
- A most of Knights in a city, scores 2 points per city tile and banner.
- A most of Monks in a monastery (1 only allowed) scores 1 point per monastery tile and each directly adjacent tile.

End of game incomplete element scoring
- A most of Thieves on a road, scores 1 point per road tile.
- A most of Knights in a city, scores 1 point per city tile and banner.
- A most of Monks in a monastery (1 only allowed) scores 1 point per monastery tile and each directly adjacent tile.
- A most of Farmers in a field score 3 points per adjacent completed city.

And the only change then for 1st edition is
- A most of Farmers around a city score 4 points for that city.


I'm really not certain at all what you mean by the total shift on the first item in your short formula list. I would find that sentence, out of context, misleading - because I would probably read "most influence in the adjacent farms" as meaning evaluate (like 3rd edition) each adjacent farm - rather than a "most farmer influence on the city from the adjacent farms" wording - which is I think what you meant. I do however think it is nice that you managed to get the concept of most influence into this line, which was lacking from all the other examples of your formula and which I feel is critical to the entire Carcassonne family (with some notable exceptions such as Guards in "The City")

I also found that example odd because the rules don't actually talk about knight or thief or monk scoring. The headings are for city, road, and monastery scoring. They are usually in the form "When a city is completed, it scores for the player with the most knights ..." with a focus on the just completed feature. Only for Farmer scoring did the original rules title the section based on the meeple-type rather than the feature (city - as the concept of farm is barely present in the original rules). So I find it odd that you would describe the view back then using the exact opposite of how they were written. (Note - I did a full translation of the original German rules, but in looking at later editions I have focused on the specific questionable areas rather than redo each in full - so the focus may have changed here.)

I don't think I ever argued, or even discussed, "more official" as a concept. I merely pointed out that the original poster was free to decide what he wanted to use as a definition of "official". Although I am happy with Jay's move to 3rd, I don't think that makes it "official across all meepledom". Not everyone accepts the idea that they need to check the net every day to make sure they are playing the game correctly. Many people will say "I own the first edition of the game, and I will play using the official first edition rules". Certainly I wouldn't try to play an ancient version of "The Game of Life" using the modern rules - if I want to play an earlier edition I want to use its rules - which would be its official rules. But I have plenty of room for others to have their own view of “official” as it applies to a game with multiple differing editions.

FARMER SCORING (for supplying the completed cities)
•Only completed cities are used for scoring farmers.
•The farmer must be in a farm that borders a city to supply it.
The distance of the farmer to the city is unimportant.
•For each city a farm supplies, the player who deployed the most
farmer(s) in the farm earns 3 points, regardless of the size of the
city. If players tie with the most farmers, each scores 3 points.
•A farm can supply (score) several cities if they border the farm.
•Several farms can supply a single city. In such a case, each farm is
scored separately, as descibed above

Not that there's anything wrong with that. Sure, you won't be playing by tournament rules, but as long as you're playing and having fun, playing a "variant" (whether it's "previous edition's official rules" or an actual variant), don't let cries of "not official" stand in your way.

I agree. As long as all those in your group know the rules that you are playing, then there is no problem with that.

Now that we have 'standardised' rules for both HiG and RGG, this eradicates problems between those who are playing officialy arguing about what is official and what's not (but both thinking they are using 'official' rules)! This is a sensible thing



Tema 400: Scoring question for siege tiles
Pregunta:
I've just got hold of the 'Cult, Siege & Creativity' expansion and don't understand the scoring in the rules for siege tiles.

The rules state -

'....Farmers do supply besieged cities. At the end of the game, each besieged city scores double. 6 points or 8 points if the scoring player has a pig in the farm.'

The base game states you score 4 points for a supplied city so shouldn't that read 8 points instead of 6 above ? With a pig on the farm 4 + 1 points and therefore shouldn't that be 10 points instead of 8 above ?

What am I missing/misundertading here? Thanks for any clarification/help on this.

Respuesta 1:
1st edition rules makes each city worth 4 and 5 with the pig so that is where you would get 8 and 10, respectively.

3rd edition rules make each city worth 3 and 4 with a pig so that is where they get the 6 and 8.

Seige, originally Cathars, was designed exclusively for 3rd edition. Now that Rio Grande has finally accepted 3rd edition rules (apparently after the release of Abbey and they realized their scoring could no longer support the new expansions), they are accepting 3rd edition expansion rules.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for the reply.

I've now tried the 3pts/supplied city as per HIG/3rd Ed. rules in several games and it seems to produce closer final score margins.

So 3pts it is from now on.

Tema 402: question about a rule
Pregunta:
on a player's turn, they can do one of the following:

1)place a tile and deploy a follower
2)place a tile to an existing road or city
3)or place a tile that completes a city, score the points and take back the meeple and that is the end of the turn

now, for #3, does the player, deploy another meeple in the same turn? i was reading the rules on page 3 and it says:

it is possible for a player to deploy a followers, score a road, city or cloister, and have the follower returned on the same turn.
1)complete a road, cloister or city with the new tile
2)deploy a knight, thief or monk
3)score the completed city, road or cloister
4)return the knightm thief or monk

can someone please clarify? thank you so much!!

Respuesta 1:
No. A player can only deploy a meeple onto the tile he placed that turn.

Given your example, the turn breaks down like this;

1)complete a road, cloister or city with the new tile Tile placed
2)deploy a knight, thief or monk Meeple placed onto the tile just played
3)score the completed city, road or cloister Scoring is done
4)return the knightm thief or monk Meeple returned to player

Respuesta 2:
This "You can do one of the following" is misleading. Your turn consists of these, in order:

1) *MANDATORY*: Draw a tile, place it anywhere where it matches the adjacent tiles (and it must be adjacent to at least one other tile). You may put your new tile anywhere that the tile edges match; completing features, meeples on the board, etc., does not matter here.

2) *OPTIONAL*: Place a meeple on an un-meepled feature on your newly placed tile. You may meeple any feature, whether completed or not, as long as it is on your newly placed tile, and there are no meeples already on the feature.

3) *MANDATORY* when it applies: Score any completed road, city, or cloister that is on the board. Players with meeples on the scored features now take those meeples back.

That makes it much more straightforward. Note that you place, then score, so if your tile completes an unoccupied feature, you can place and score right away as long as you have a free meeple!

Which Carc scoring do you prefer, broken down by continent
One of the most discussed topics in the Carcassonne forum is farm scoring. On a recent thread (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2655071) someone commented that “Most people outside germany play by the 1st edition rules, since thats what is in the english version. Most german people play by the 3rd edition rules, since these are in the majority of the games sold in germany.” This made me wonder which rules are more popular in a population such as ours that actually has access to both rules. I thought it would be interesting to break it down by continent as well, since, as referenced in the quote, most North Americans will have bought the RGG version with 1st edition rules.

As a refresher (I can't go back in and edit the poll description and don't want to re-type the whole thing again, so had to stick this at the bottom...):
1st edition: 2 points only for 2-tile “football” cities; farms scored from perspective of city.
3rd edition: full 4 points for 2-file “football” cities; farms scored from perspective of farms.
I didn’t include 2nd edition since my understanding is not many people play it, so it would be small enough to lump in the “neither” option.

Respuesta 1:
There may be more people playing 2nd edition than you expect - 2nd edition is what is used on AsoBrain, and by default on BSW. It's the same as 3rd edition but with 2 key differences:

- 2-tile "football" cities are worth 2 points. This makes sense to me as it reduces the luck factor.

- You can't score the same city multiple times from different fields. This makes sense to me themeatically.

Respuesta 2:
I play the rules that come in the box of the set that we are playing with at the time. I am pretty sure our set has a different scoring rules than a friends of ours set does, so the ruling was the rules that are in the box rule unless decided otherwise before hand. The interesting thing is that they are both English language editions and I had thought that there was no change in those. Possibly this is not the case, although not all English language editions are published by RGG.

Respuesta 3:
Thanks to all those who voted! Interesting results so far, with 70 total votes.

North America prefers 3rd edition, as I expected. But the ratio is only 2:1, I didn't anticipate so many would be in the 1st ed. column.

Europe follows the same pattern; surprising to me, as I'd imagine most in Europe buy HIG which has had 3rd ed. for a while, which I had thought might bias their preference.

Australia has an admittedly smaller sample size, but it seems pretty equal between 3rd and 1st.

And thanks to the lone voter from South America!

Before the release of the "Abbey and Mayor" expansion, we played by 1st edition rules (2 points for football city, farms were scored per city)

Whenever we play with the Barn from "Abbey and Mayor", we score the farms with 3rd edition rules (score per farm), but we have always kept football cities to 2 points.

Respuesta 8:
2 points (total) for 2 tile cities when they close.
Each complete city, including size 2 cities, pay 3 points to the color(s) with the most adjacent farmers.

Although, I've also gone with Fraser's scheme of playing however the rules in the set being used state.

Respuesta 9:
The official 3rd ed German rules have each city scored at 3 points unless you have a pig, then it's 4 points. 3rd ed is supposed to be the one to work best with expansions.

Having each city, no matter the size, give the same points for the farmers makes it easier to learn and count the farms but also promote building more and smaller cities. Since each city already can take food from multiple farms I see no problem with small ones giving 3 points, it can only be connected to 1 farm anyway.

Cheap points are one of the joys of Carcassonne! My fiance and I call any cheap points "quick n' dirty" (city, road, etc). I don't think it hinders board expansion - I mean, the board is going to expand no matter what, you have to use all the tiles, and cheap points are not going to win you the game.

We didn't realize there were various editions to the rules until we got the Abbey and Mayor a few weeks ago and couldn't figure how the farming was supposed to work. One quick trip to the 'geek and all was revealed. We both like the 3rd edition farmer scoring better, it is much simpler, but I also have a few reservations, after just 2 games playing this way, that it inflates scores quite a bit. Instinctively, I like the tougher, lower scoring results of the 1st edition rules. I feel this rule change really shifts the overall strategy for me, at least in terms of farmer placement (which I tend to spend more time than my partner worrying over) - I'm just not sure what the implications are yet.

Interesting variant! I might try this, since for me half the fun of Carcassonne is creating really nice landscapes and cityscapes (while trying to win at the same time), and I'm always slightly disappointed when there's a bunch of ugly football cities littering the landscape. Yet sometimes I can't resist the quick points.

I love how Carc is so flexible based on who you're playing, and what mood you're in - it works equally well in a cut-throat, strategic battle between two buddy gamers as it does a peaceful meditative session with family or less aggressive friends. If I'm playing in the former context, I'm less likely to mind the 2-tilers.

Respuesta 12:
When I play with the earlier, per city, rules there's always this tense farmer war going on (plain Carc). Usually there's 1 big farm connected to most cities. So, whoever get the most farmers in the big farm is most likely to win with a huge margin, especially if it's 4 points per city.

With 3rd ed it's more fun to place farmers because every little farm can score points even when the cities are connected to a larger farm on the other side. You are also not as encouraged to connect all farms together for that massive 30-40 point farm. It's a more balanced game. Oh, and these huge farms are usually a pain to score because you have to check every city for possible outside farmers.

What about when you have a meeple on a single city tile and your wife finishes your city as a "football" city? Do you get no points and just pick up your meeple? Or is an opponent not allowed to finish your single tile city?

Thanks,

Respuesta 14:
I prefer 2 points for small (2-tile, football) cities. Fields score 3 points for each city on that field (no double credit for supplying the same city from different fields).

It encourages players to build up cities (which is good since 2 tile cities have no player interaction), and prevents one large field from completely dominating all scoring (as you can get those points by claiming multiple fields on the far side of the cities). For my groups, it made for the most interesting games. It helps that these were also the same rules used on BSW, which didn't require the cleanup afterwards.

Same here.

I have to say though it is annoying that there are 3 different rules. Only time will tell.



Tema 405: 3rd edition/small city "new" rules....who made them up?
Pregunta:
are the new "3rd" edition farm rules in any way official? what about small city rule (2 pts total for a 2 tile city)?

are these printed/posted somewhere by the offical gamemaker or are these simply made up by players who disliked the offical rules? like monoply where you put the money in the middle and landing on free parking gets it all (everyone does that but it's not an offical rule!)

if they are "real" rules where can i find them?

Respuesta 1:
I beleive the new rules you speak of come from HIG. I'm not certain though. The best resource i know for comparing the various versions of the rules is the file http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/22896. this file has the rules and FAQ for all expansions. It also goes over the changes in the rules for the different editions and the differences between the rules progression for the HIG releases and the RioGrande releases.

The biggest thing i'd say is making sure everyone agrees on a set of rules to use ahead of time. When playing with new people I use the most recent set of rules form HIG.

If I'm not mistaken, 1st edition rules are 2 pts for a 2 tile city, while 3rd edition rules were updated to be 4 pts for a 2 tile city. I believe this change was made to encourage completing more cities, and it worked better with more expansions.

As for who made up 3rd edition rules, I think it was the German designer and/or publisher of the game. The US publisher (Rio Grande) for some reason just has decided to stick with 1st edition rules.

There is just one maker: Hans im Glück - and they have corrected the rules throughout the years. The current ruleset is the 3rd or 4th. Major corrections were how to give points for farms. This has changed from 4 points to 3 points per city, and now each farm is counted seperately instead of each city. Cities can now be accounted for multiple farms.

Sort of.

Hans im Glück is the German publisher and Rio Grande is the U.S. publisher.

As I recall, Hans im Glück changed the rules because they felt the old farm rules were confusing. Rio Grande has stuck with the rules because they disagreed that they were confusing.

Different people play with different sets of the rules. There is even a second edition which, if I recall correctly, were never actually pulished in the game but were from Hans im Glück's web site.

Most people outside germany play by the 1st edition rules, since thats what is in the english version. Most german people play by the 3rd edition rules, since these are in the majority of the games sold in germany. The online implementation in Brettspielwelt (BSW) uses the 2nd edition rules, since these were the official rules at the time when the game was implemented there.

If you plan on getting the 'Abbey and Mayor' expansion then you are forced into 3rd edition rules (both RGG and HiG assume 3rd edition rules are being used in this expansion).

However, I have heard that recently RGG are now re-issuing Carcassonne with 3rd edition rules.

They really do make the game a lot less confusing.

To obtain the 3rd edition rules, download a copy of Matt Harper's CAR for Carcassonne and it's expansions. The CAR is available from here or from www.carcassonnecentral.com. An indispensible aid, which should be at the side of every player.

Note that the "majority of the users at www.carcassonnecentral.com" is likely a very small sampling of those who actually play the game.

When I first heard it mentioned that Rio Grande was distributing the 3rd edition of the rules, I checked their site and the rules there were still the original rules. I can't check Abbey and Mayor right now, but I don't recall how they assumed you were using the HiG rules. we've played it with the original rules and it works just fine.

Respuesta 10:
I think Matt Harper puts it well in his CAR (Ver 4.1):

Quote:
"The release of the latest expansion - Abbey and Mayor - may have changed the situation significantly. It was nearly inevitable that at some point HiG would release an expansion which would simply be incompatible with 1st edition farmer scoring; and now we have an expansion that potentially simplifies farmer scoring at the end of the game if you're using 3rd edition rules, but will easily double the complexity if you're still using 1st edition rules. I'll explain.
The new expansion features a barn - one for each player - which can only be placed at the intersection of four farm segments. Any farmers currently on that farm are immediately scored (3 points per adjacent city) and removed. Any farmers which, later in the game, join the farm through connecting tiles are also scored (1 point per adjacent city)and removed. At the end of the game, the barn scores 4 points per adjacent city. When I first read the German rules, I wondered how RGG would adapt them. Potentially, the farmer removal and scoring could go ahead as usual, although it would be odd - after all, if only the farmers on one farm need to be removed, why should a city count all the other adjacent farms to produce a score? Possible, but weird. The real problem would come at the end, though - if you score farms from the perspectives of the cites, how would you judge the value or strength of the barn? Clearly, it trumps farmers - is it worth two of them? Does it over-rule farmers on other farms touching the city? Hmm.
Well, the official RGG rules did something I didn't expect: they stuck precisely to the German rules. That is, the farmers being removed score 3 points (or 1 point) per adjacent city, and the barn scores 4 points per adjacent city at the end. The barn, in both HiG and RGG rules, uses 3rd edition scoring.
But there is no indication anywhere in the rules that RGG farmer scoring in general should now follow 3rd edition rules. In other words, at the end of the game, it seems you're meant to calculate the two elements separately, using 1st edition for farmers and 3rd edition for barns. Twice as complicated, as I said.
Compare that with the effect of the barn if you're using 3rd edition rules for everything: the mechanic is consistent, there should be fewer farmers in play (and so less counting) and fewer wars for the majority. The barn should actually simplify the game…"
I will freely admit that I found the scoring of farms difficult to grasp when I first played using 1st edition rules, but much easier using 3rd edition.

Maybe I should not have used the sentence "both RGG and HiG assume 3rd edition rules are being used in this expansion". Perhaps RGG do not assume this, but the scoring is identical to HiG's rules (which do assume 3rd edition scoring). To properly translate over, for RGG to implement 1st edition rules, surely when the barn is added to a field already containing farmers, the farmers should immediately score 4 points (and not 3) and then be removed. Similarly, at game end the barn should score 5 points per city and not 4! 3rd edition rules score farms at 3 points per completed city with the barn showing it's strength by adding an extra point to usual farmer scoring at game end. Using 1st edition the barn has no real strength of its own at game end.

Of course, i'm a fan of 3rd edition rules and am biased

Why? The rules for the Barn fit perfectly in the world of the bastions of intelligence and clear thinking that is the first edition movement.

It just means that if you lose your farmer to the Barn being placed then you score one less point per city, but you get the meeple back to use it again. You're assuming that Jay didn't change the rules because he agreed with the third edition scoring, not because it was just easier to leave it as HiG did it. Who knows? All I know is that the rules work perfectly fine as written.

The Barn still works as a tool to remove other's farmers (and your own, allowing you to score 7, or more, points per city if your farmer was removed. It also locks the field under your control unless someone else manages to get another Barn into the same field, guaranteeing you will score points for completed cities on the farm at the end of the game. There is never a guarantee that you will score with a farmers on a farm.

I think some of you are just reaching to justify your misguided belief that Rio Grande will suddenly change how farms are scored after eight years of keeping the original rules.

I don't know. Everyone I know has the original rules. There are thousands of copies of them out there and I suspect that the change will never be made because of that. I guess I would just go with what others wanted to play with and would teach whatever edition someone had. If I taught the game to someone who would be buying it new, with the rule change, then I would change to the 3rd edition so not to be confusing to them.

i'll play a few games a few ways to see what works maybe.

i must say i like 3rd edition farm rules (its the way i mistakenly played the 1st edition rules at first! only with 4 pts per city)

but going down to 3 points/city does make sense since cities get scored more than once (i guess).

what about small city=2pts..is that official?

now that i think about it..1st edition rules make for more challenging farm use in a way; you can battle for control of a city from a seperate farm (on the other side of a city ). and it makes sense in a 'real world' way...a small city wouldnt be paying all the different farmers..just the one color who control from all around the city.

Yes, it is official in 1st edition rules! In 3rd edition rules it reverts to 2 points per tile, therefore a small city scores 4 points using 3rd edition rules!

However, when I first used 3rd edition rules, our group kept the small city = 2 points for some time, before moving completely over to 3rd edition rules. Many people using 3rd edition still keep the small city = 2 points in their games, but with 3rd edition rules this is simply a 'house rule' and not the official position. This works quite well in 3rd edition games, the only agreement needing to be reached is what will you score a small city that is completed by the Abbey? As Mr. Warren () suggests above, 1 point is logical. Hope this helps, whatever rules you decide to play with

Tema 408: Differing farmer rules?
Pregunta:
I apologize — I'm too lazy to look this up.

Do different editions of Carcassonne have different farmer rules?

Here's how the question came up. A few weeks ago I played a game with a mix of people I'd played with before and people I hadn't. We did the scoring, and we score for each player who has the same number of farmers on a city. For instance, if two players have two farmers each on a city, while a third has one farmer there, the first two each get credit for supplying that city.

The person I hadn't played with before was dismayed by this, saying her rules stated that in the case of a tie like above, neither farmer got credit — it was essentially a "dead" farm.

Bonus story for entertainment purposes only: I and the evil always-wins player each had two farmers on the same area. I knew he'd seize any opportunity to place a third and get it all to himself, so early on I looked for the same opportunity myself…and got it. Even better, this guy didn't notice I'd snuck a third farmer in. Later in the game he begins cackling how he's going to place his third farmer there and take over, while I'm doing my best to try to keep my mouth shut. He placed the third farmer, then noticed my third, wondering incredulously how long it had been there.

Respuesta 1:

@Luminous
Do different editions of Carcassonne have different farmer rules?
They do, but not in the way you're describing. In all editions of the main series, tied features award full points to all players tied for the meeple lead in that feature.

In Carc the Castle, the rules say neither scores in a tie - but that's an offshoot of it being a strictly 2 player game. In a 2 player game, bother players gaining N points, or neither, doesn't affect the point difference between the players, so they went with 'don't score'. That may be the source of confusion.

Respuesta 2:
Also, the German second edition changed the farmer rule considerably.

Rio Grande and German 1st Edition: Go city-by-city. Add up all farmers in meadows around each city. Whoever has the most gets 4 points for the city, a tie means all tied players get 4 points each.

German 2nd edition: Go meadow-by-meadow. Add up all farmers in a meadow. Whoever has the most gets 3 points for each completed city that borders that meadow, a tie means all tied players get 3 points each.

I don't think there has ever been a rule where meeples owned by the same player in different meadows "compete" for plurality.

Tema 409: Rio Grand Games now including 3rd Edition rules instead of 1st
Pregunta:
Good day to all,

It was just recently brought to my attention that the Rio Grand Games copy of Carc I picked up last Sunday includes the 3rd Edition rules instead of the 1st Edition rules that they usually include. I am very new to BGG and euro-style games, and Carc is the first game of this type I've ever purchased/played. So, I was quite unaware that there were even different editions of the rules available, let alone some publishers including older rule editions.

So anyway...I have an email into RGG to confirm that this is true, but I'd assume so as my copy definitely has the 3rd edition rules. Just thought everyone would like to know as I've seen a few complaining about RGG still using the 1st edition.

Respuesta 1:
Amazing if true. I just checked the rules that RGG have online, and they're still 1st edition. Any chance of a scan and upload?

Respuesta 2:
I can definitely do that. I'll post back here when it's done.

Respuesta 3:
Thanks! That'd be great.

Respuesta 4:
Hey guys...

Sorry I haven't gotten around to the scan yet. I was hoping to run it through a scanner at work, as I haven't had a scanner at home for at least 8 years, but they keep them closely guarded. I'll continue to try, but if someone else would like to scan the rules in the meantime, feel free.

On a good note though...here's the response I got from Jay at Rio Grande Games...preceded by my inquiry:

Quote:
I just recently purchased a copy of Carcassonne from my local game store and it contained the 3rd edition rules. Are you guys now packaging 3rd edition rules with your Carcassonne now instead of the 1st edtion?

Chris

I am not certain what you mean by third edition rules. I did recently change the rules to match the German rules and since this is my first change, I suppose you could say they are second edition rules, but I have not labeled them as such.

Hope this helps!

If you can't get a scan don't worry. I'm sure we'll get it sorted in the end :-)

I just tried introducing the so called new rules(3rd edition)to my eleven year old daughter and she was not happy. We only bought carcassonne last year with first edition rules and play then quite easily. It's a bit annoying that they would actually change a rule in a game which still for all intense and purposes looks unchanged otherwise. Anyhow after reading around BGG I can see that this farmer rule has a miscreant history. I just wonder if RGG bowed to peer pressure from ...?. I keep meaning to try playing with this 3rd edition rule, but it's hard to get 1st edition out of my head. And is it really that much better. This would be a hard question to answer unbiasedly. Any takers.

That depends on who "they" are and when when you start measuring "still". The 3rd Edition rules appeared quickly after the 1st (and short-lived 2nd) but the RGG edition rules weren't updated to reflect this until now. So you could just as easily say that it's annoying that RGG waited so long to change.

It's really a matter of taste and experience. I think if you like the 1st Edition rules and don't feel like changing, why bother?

The reason I, personally, prefer them is simple: When I was working on my summary it quickly became clear that all expansions that referred to fields assumed the 3rd Edition rules.

I'll try. No it isn't that much better. It may be worse. Depends.

If you want to play with all the expansions then you will probably have problems if you stay with 1st. Although you can twist Abbey and Mayor into 1st edition rules, it will probably just feel convoluted and wrong. The previous expansions can all work with 1st okay, though especially the pig in Traders and Builders will be played slightly differently.

Personally, I think the gameplay is better balanced and more interesting when using 1st edition rules if you are playing only the base game, or the base game and expansion one (Inns and Cathedrals). That view is based on long experience with a variety of play styles and groups. If I was looking at any one of those groups and their common playstyle, then in some cases 1st would be the better answer and in others 3rd would be. (And that doesn't always correlate with which rules they are using.) So results vary with how the group typically interacts.

You didn't mention if you have any of the expansions. If not (or if only I&C) then I would suggest sticking with 1st, which your daughter already knows and is comfortable with. If you have other expansions or want to add some, you may want to look around the forums here and try to get a sense of which might be better choices and which will be problematic (A&M certainly).

I hope that is objective enough - I actually prefer 3rd edition overall - but I'm not a "rabid 3rd editioner" so maybe I can be somewhat objective.

FYI: The Game of Life changed it's rules without any obvious change to the packaging or any notice on the outside about the changed rules. The rules inside don't mention any differing previous version - even in the nostalgia edition. But I don't expect the market for that would ever think of playing an old set using the new rules.

BTW: If you really want to know about the peer pressure issue - I can send you my take on it, as I followed all the developments in both German and English (as I can read both). But I won't rehash them here. Nor do I suspect your were seriously wanting to know.

Respuesta 12:
3rd ed makes it easier to score farmers, you simply take it one farm at a time instead of figuring out who can deliver to which city. Makes farms more like roads and cities.



Tema 410: Strange Cloister Rule
Pregunta:
I have some Czech friends who have Carcassonne. I had never known this, and was delighted when I found out. But when I played with them, I found out they were playing with a strange cloister rule.

It states: "You may not place a cloister directly adjacent to another cloister."
I immediately told them that I said nothing of the sort in the rules. Then again, they had the Czech version of the game, and I couldn't read Czech.

So I was wondering: Does this strange rule actually exist in other versions of the game, or was it a quirk in the learners' minds?

Respuesta 1:
I've never played that way and don't recall seeing it in the rules. As far as I know there are no restrictions on tile placement other than all sides have to match.

Respuesta 2:

Even on Brettspielwelt this rule isn't applied. So I believe it don't exists.

It doesn't really make any sense why you could not place a cloister adjacent to another cloister, provided that the tile borders matched up. Can you not place a city next to another city, or a road next to another road?

No, this single rule exception to apply to a single type of tile does not fit with the elegance of the game's ruleset, and really doesn't even accomplish anything useful. I call BS!

Actually, I can find why. It is that many times the best way to place a cloister is with another cloister, and I have had it many times where there is a huge cluster of them all together. So wherever they got that rule from may have been trying to prevent this "freeloading".

From the FAQ:

Quote:
Can cloisters be placed directly next to each other, or corner to corner, or must there always be eight other tiles neighbouring a cloister?

Why ever not? A cloister stands in the middle of a farm segment and other segments can be can be placed next to it. The sentence “cloister tiles cannot be continued” identifies cloisters as closed segments. In contrast to roads, cities and farms it is not possible to connect to a cloister. In the example shown every monk occupies its own cloister, which will be scored independently of the neighbouring cloisters.

There are no religious conflicts in the Basic Game of Carcassonne!

They must have interpreted the rules wrong, as the FAQ pointed out. Thank you very much!

Respuesta 11:
I've never heard of this rule either. A group of adjacent cloisters is practically the road/city equivelent of "backdooring" "into" another player's cloister plane. You wanna stop "freeloading", make up house rules about moving into people's cities, roads, and farms while you're at it.

I know for sure BSW doesN'T implement it that way. One 2p game I came out ahead by placing a tile that allowed me to close all 3 of my cloisters for 27 points. Screenshot upon request.... and if I still have it.

Well, just so you don't leave empty handed, the cloisters were laid out like so:

with the bottom one having a road going down. The empty space to the bottom left was last missing tile that closed all 3 cloisters in the same turn.

Respuesta 13:
I've never seen this either. Additionally on the Xbox live verson of this game - there is an achivement that can be earned if you can place 2 cloisters adjacent to each other. So along with all the others - and the game mechanics online - it would seem this might be a "house" rule and not an official one.

Respuesta 14:
I have one swedish Midgaard games copy of this game, and one english Enigma copy, and I can't find this rule in any of them.

Well, I can see one reason for this (except for the one above), and it's quite logical.

Think: how do cloisters get points? From taking money from the farms surrounding it, right? And if two cloisters are adjacent or even placed with one tile between them, they steal money from the same farms! And then there would be lots of quarrels, brawls, battles and stone throwing between the both blood-thirsty crusaders' cloisters. So to avoid this, the rules don't allow monks to build their cloisters close to eachother.

I don't think this is a good rule, but that's my logical explanation.

Well, then the poor farmers would just pay all monks equally. In that case, theives on roads should get split VPs as well from the poor wayfarers they're robbing, but it's still equal points for both thieves



Tema 411: 1st ed farmer scoring question
Pregunta:
Ok, so I just found out that there are more then one set of rules but for now I will be playing the 1st ed rules.

So my question is: Do you score the cities based on the total number of farmers or do you define ownership of the farms and then score based on the total number of farms?

Example:
There are 2 farms A and B connected to a city. In Farm A there is 2 blue farmers and in Farm B there is only 1 red farmer, do both get 4 points (1 farm each) or do only blue score (2 farmers vs 1 farmer)?

Respuesta 1:
You take each city, determine ownership of that city based on the number of farmers in the farms touching it, and the player with the most farmers wins the 4 points. The most each city will give any one player is 4 points. However, the same farm could be used multiple times for multiple cities.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks Brian, that's how I've been playing the game so far. Because the winner of the BIG farm in each game seems to win the game I was unsure if this was the correct way to play. In most games I've played so far there have been one big farm that connects to many cities giving the owner loads of points in the end.

Respuesta 3:
When there is a big farm in play, the other players should be doing their best to get in on it (by placing followers in small outlying farms then joining the smaller farms to the bigger one).

If you allow there to be a huge farm and you're not in on it (IE, tied for the most followers), then you've made a deservedly poor showing.

Tema 412: Carcassonne- Inns and Cathedrals large meeples on roads with inn on the lake
Pregunta:
Just a quick question. When a large meeple is on a road with the inn on the lake on it, how is it scored?

Respuesta 1:
2 points per tile if complete, otherwise it's 0. The size of the meeple doesn't affect the scoring, unless there's a contest to the ownership of the road.

Respuesta 2:
as Jason says, in Carcassonne, the size of the meeple does not affect the scoring, it is however worth two ordinary meeples for the purpose of determining who controls a road/city etc.

In The Ark of the Covenant however, the big meeple is scored differently.

Respuesta 3:

@Zalasta

........ I really don't like how that's worded. Also similar to how it's worded in the BSW help pages. By saying "unless" to "doesn't affect scoring", it almost makes it sound like there are some circumstances when the score changes.... as in the amount of score you obtain changes. Instead, the big meeple should be mentioned as strictly for control..... whether or not you get the points or not (e.g. you either get 14 pts or nothing).... not some other score value (e.g. 14 pts for a regular meeple, 20 pts for a large meeple)

Respuesta 4:
Besides, its not the size of the meeple that counts, its how you use it.

Tema 414: A naive question from a new Carcassonne player
Pregunta:
Putting myself on the block here, but I've never played Carcassonne before, nor seen it played. I recently acquired the game and have gone through the instructions in preparation to...hopefully...play this weekend with my wife and daughter. The rules seem simple enough...farm scoring aside, though I think even that is approachable. However, I noticed this little "aside" in the rules:

"Placing land tiles
First a player must draw a land tile from one of the face-down stacks. He looks at it, shows it to his fellow players (so
they can advise him on the "best" placement of the tile), and places it on the table,..."

Now, I realize I'm risking looking like a fool here, but in a game that seems to be decidedly competitive, ie, there is a clear winner in the person who scores the most points, I must assume that the statement about showing the tile to fellow players for advice about placement must be tongue in cheek, particularly given that the word "best" has quotation marks. Since tile placement is one of the key strategic elements of the game it appears that a democratic discussion would certainly undermine each players' tactical approach to play. Perhaps with many recent games of Pandemic under my belt (wife and daughter love that one), I'm in a somewhat cooperative mindset, so I want to be certain.

As I said, I've not yet played, nor seen the game played, so please forgive my ignorance here, but I want the experience to be a positive one over the weekend in the hopes of getting more playing time in.

Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
Yes, that statement *is* meant to be tongue in cheek, however as you noticed, it carries a small bit of seriousness.

It is generally accepted, and backed up by computer versions of the game, that the tile you draw on your turn is public information. Other players are allowed to see its contents while you are figuring out where to place it.

It is my experience in face-to-face games that the current player is OFTEN influenced by table talk on where they ultimately place the tile. Hence, the comment in the rules and its effect on the gameplay.

Respuesta 2:
In multi-player games, this could definintely influence the tile's placement. You won't see that happen in 2-player games though.

Respuesta 3:
So as a "Verteran" player, I'll make myself look foolish as well and say: I don't know!

My assumotion is that it is one of the following or a combination of them all:
1) tongue in cheeck
2) a means to promote the friendly aspect of a family game
3) a means to allow everyone to bribe you with promises of future considerations in a competitive game.
4) a means to ensure all possible placement options are located and considered
5) a means to speed up the game

It is present in most, if not all, of the rules for all the incarnations. We don't enforce it, however because we are pretty fast players and no one wants "help" anyways. I only encourage it if we happen to have new players to help them develop a sens of the game (as in example 2 above) or as a means to threaten a slow player into picking up the pace.

There is no harm in showing the piece as it is going to be public info soon enough and players can't stop you placing it. However, it has lead to verbal assault from our more mild-mannered players when her spouse helped someone else by suggesting a placement of the tile where she wanted to go.

Respuesta 4:
Well, of course the statement is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as you cannot always expect your opponents to give you fair advice However, it is more fun if you show the tile you drew to your opponents, as it gives them something to think about during your turn, which makes the game more fun.

As for the advice: usually, when I play Carcassonne, it is rather friendly, and people will give eachother good advice. (Of course, the will usually not advice you to try and take their city away from them... But sometimes they will even do that ) If you start asking questions (like "does anyone see a spot where I can create a two-tile city"), you'll usually get fair answers. I guess it just speeds the game up, as the player with the tile will see that spot eventually, if he just goes over the board systematically.

Respuesta 5:
Directing someone with "best" advice is half the fun.

We love Carcassonne and have a few of the expansions too but we never use farmers as we just don't like them no matter which edition of rules are used--and the game still more than works!

Respuesta 6:
As a player new to the game as well I have found it very helpful, when playing with the wife and/or nephews , to see the tile and suggest a placement as well as the strategy behind it. Of course this will help everybody develop and become better players increasing the competitiveness of the games played.

Of course once everybody has a feel for the game the "suggestions" will be minimized!

TOH

Edit: We didn't play with the farmer the first couple of games either, but now we've had several plays under our belts it brings in sooooo much more strategy to the game.

She's a pretty sharp cookie with a surprising sense of strategy, so it might not be a problem at all.

After all this hypothetical discussion, I'm dying to finally play.

Respuesta 12:
I hope you have a great time, and let us know how the session went. Also, I hope you go ahead and use farmers, since they're an integral part of the game. Would you teach someone chess while leaving out the rooks and knights, or (perhaps a better analogy) teach them Settlers of Catan while leaving out the development cards? Of course not!

I think the thing to do is simply remind new players to be very careful about when they put down a farmer, since it will remain where it is permanently until game's end (until, of course, you begin playing with any of the various expansions that might alter that situation).

Have fun!

An order of play question arose last night: in a situation where a player has no more meeples, but places a tile that completes another project, thereby returning one to his/her pile, can that player place that meeple on the newly placed tile in that turn? For purposes of our game we decided that, yes, the player (me, actually, and it was my daughter who ultimately ruled in the affirmative) could use the newly returned meeple to create a new Knight (or Thief, etc., depending on the tile).

No.

Placing meeples comes before scoring. So if you have no meeples available you can't place. Once you score and get a meeple returned the placing phase has passed.

Respuesta 18:
Glad to hear you're enjoying a bit of Carc!

To your question the order is -

Draw tile
Lay tile
Place meeple
Score completed features (picking up meeples)

So as you can see you can't put down the meeple you've just scored with, so your ruling was incorrect, I guess it's to make you a bit more hesitant about committing your last meeple the board. Of course, as with all games, you should play the way you enjoy it the most.

Something I've found over many games of Carcassonne and having taught it to almost everyone I know is that while the blokes in general will just flip a tile so all can see while they are making their mind up, the girls are far more likely to hold it hidden in their hand while they decide. Not quite sure why, I always take the mick that it's a female greed thing (tongue firmly in cheek), but I wonder if it's a confidence thing, the blokes are happier with gaming in general (as it tends to be my long time friends who are mostly gamers of some water and whichever long-suffering women we have found to put up with us) and can deal with the 'helpful suggestions' without getting distracted or worried.

Anyway, it's a great game, first I got my wife addicted to Carcassonne, now she bothers my to play Twilight Struggle and Agricola...couldn't be happier!

Not quite sure why, I always take the mick that it's a female greed thing (tongue firmly in cheek), but I wonder if it's a confidence thing, the blokes are happier with gaming in general (as it tends to be my long time friends who are mostly gamers of some water and whichever long-suffering women we have found to put up with us) and can deal with the 'helpful suggestions' without getting distracted or worried.

Anyway, it's a great game, first I got my wife addicted to Carcassonne, now she bothers my to play Twilight Struggle and Agricola...couldn't be happier!
Got it. And of course it makes sense. Even when playing it that way last night, there was a nagging in the back of my mind that this was a function of the limited resources and that it might be too easy if we let it slide. Good to know, guys. Thanks.

Russell, it's funny you mention that in your experience the gals tend to play the tiles close to the vest...I find myself often gently exhorting my daughter and wife to show their tile. I don't even mind, actually, not seeing it right away, but we were playing with the mindset of learning together, and I'm always curious about what's coming.

Twilight Struggle and Agricola as well, eh? Haven't had the pleasure of playing either yet, but I'm happy for you that you've got someone so interested in playing several "gamers" games with you. Life is indeed good, my friend.



Tema 415: City Tile Confusion
Pregunta:
(I had an argument about this with my 8yr old daughter last night)

Look at the following image:

http://boardgamegeek.com/image/74775

The piece I have problems with is the piece found on the bottom row - the third tile in. It's the one with two city 'ends' on it.

Are those two ends connected to the same city? The image on the tile looks like they are connected. My daughter said they were joined, I ruled they were not. Obviously, if other city tiles connect them - they become the same city - but if I put one 'end' of her city, can I put a Meeple on the other 'end'.

I ruled it my way becuase I am older and it's my game (who says I'm not a big kid at heart)

Respuesta 1:
You mean the third tile in from the right, correct? You are right. Just as in the picture, they can complete two different cities, so you could place a meeple on the unclaimed city space. You are also right that the correct placement of tiles would make it two ends of one city.

Respuesta 2:
Dammit - my original draft said 'from the right'.

Thanks for clearing it up for me. I'm glad I was right. I think I'll make her go to bed early tonight to teach her a lesson

Respuesta 3:
I'd say so as well. That tile you describe denotes 2 different cities.

Respuesta 5:

Respuesta 6:
I played last night with my family, and the same type of city configuration came up. But this time, my father-in-law was arguing that the corners of the cities actually allowed the farms to be connected.

I haven't seen this covered in the forums anywhere, so I'll ask the question here. If two cities come together in a "point", does the little gap indicate that the farms are connected, or do the walls still separate the farms?

Respuesta 7:
That piece is actually the one you hope to draw to block someone who is trying to join up one of their smaller cities with your big one. That piece keeps them separated out.

Tema 416: 3rd edition rules vs. 1st edition rules: question for people who have played both...
Pregunta:
I used to play 1st edition rules (as are bundled with RGG Carcassonne, which even includes an extra page devoted to explaining the farm rules), but after going through BGG, I have since converted to 3rd edition rules.

About farming, I have this grief about 3rd edition rules. So imagine two cities and two farms, arranged FARM1|CITY1|FARM2|CITY2. The cities are completed. Now, FARM1 and FARM2 are adjacent to CITY1, but only CITY2 is adjacent to FARM2, got it? Okay, now in imagine that FARM1 has a red meeple, and imagine that FARM2 has a red meeple and a blue meeple. In 1st edition rules under these conditions, red would get 8 points and blue would get 4 points. In 3rd edition rules, red would get 9 points and blue would get 6 points. NOW, imagine that FARM1 and FARM2 were merged, in 1st ed. rules, this would be BENEFICIAL to red (by keeping blue from gaining any points), but in 3rd edition rules, this is BAD for red! The merging of these farms in 1st ed. rules would make red have 8 points and blue have none; however, in 3rd ed. rules, it would make red LOSE 3 points, going from 9 to 6 points! Due to this, I firmly believe that a farm scoring system based on farms and not on cities is inferior.

Discussion?

Respuesta 1:
There is going to be a trade-off going from one edition scoring to another. In isolated cases, you can make an argument why 1st edition is a better scoring system. And if I felt like spending the time, I could come up with the perfect scenario that would show 3rd Edition is superior.

The point is that if you know which system you are using, then you should learn to maximize your scoring potential in whatever way you can. If you think the above situations is bad for Red, then don't put red farmers in those locations!

I still feel 3rd edition is the superior form of farm scoring for the following reasons:
- It is an easier method to describe to new players and more accessible to everyone else.
- It is similar to the method used for scoring roads and cities so it is very intuitive.
- When the time comes to score, it inherently keeps track of which farms have been scored and makes it easier to tally the points
- All (or at least most all) of the expansions have been designed with 3rd edition in mind, with none being more obvious than the Barns in A&M

Is it possible that 1st edition grants more points? Sure but I don't think it is a foregone conclusion that 1st edition always scores more points. Moreso than that, 3rd edition has opened up farming. When we played 1st edition, everyone shied away from farming. Now that we play 3rd edition, farms are just as contested as cities and more people participates.

Overall, 3rd edition has been far superior for having fun in the game and ease of scoring. I'll never go back to 1st edition.

Respuesta 2:
I don't have the rules in front of me so I'm not positive if this is an official rule or a variant... but I've always played, using 3rd edition farming rules, that you can't score the same city twice with your farmers. Thus:

In 1st edition rules under these conditions, red would get 8 points and blue would get 4 points. In 3rd edition rules, red would get 9 points and blue would get 6 points.
Here red and blue would each get 6 points.

Again, here I would say red is holding steady at 6 points when the farms merge. But more importantly, and regardless of if you allow a player to score the same city twice, blue went from 6 points to 0, so it's still a net benefit to red.

I know a lot of people like to play Carc in a semi-cooperative way and get annoyed at aggressive tactics, but there are many situations where it's more effective to deny your opponent points than to score points for yourself.

This must be a variant or confusion over the two sets of rules. Each city is only counted once in 1st edition. However, in 3rd Edition, a city can count up to as many times as different fields touch it.

Quite simply, 1st edition scores city by city. 3rd edition scores field by field. But in both cases, your points are coming from the city. It is just 4 points per city in 1st edition and 3 points per in 3rd.

That is 2nd edition rules. 3rd edition allows you to score a city with multiple farms.

Respuesta 5:
I think he was trying to say that, prior to the farms merging, red had 9 points total in farms. After the merge, he had 6 points in farms. Relatively speaking he lost 3 points because of the merge, but so did blue.

I am used to the 1st edition rules. 4 points (once per city) is valuable enough to keep some competition in the farms. However, I do not even give the rules for farmers to new players until they are comfortable with the game.

Respuesta 6:
I am playing 1st edition rules and Iove how it works, you have to be smart enough to understand how it works to take advantage of it - to me it is pretty simple ( follow the open fields on the puzzle ) - I like how you try and be sneaky and add farmers to the biggest fields to share points or get all the points if you can get an extra farmer in there.
I am sure when I get some expansions I switch over to 3rd ed. rules, but for now I think it is a great game and everyone else really seems to enjoy it.

Respuesta 12:
I'd just like to pop back in with a quick note.
You all bring valid points, and perhaps the game can be best enjoyed by players trying both sets of rules and attempting to master each ruleset's intricacies.

I accept 3rd edition rules as the real rules. I now play by 3rd edition rules almost every single game, and introduce players to the game using 3rd edition rules. Still, I do not like the idea of a player being able to lose points due to a merger of farms.

Take my original example, but this time, remove blue's meeple. Red has control of both farms, and is slated to get nine points. Let's say that blue notices this, and craftily places tiles to merge farms 1 and 2. That action alone would lower red's points by three. It is because of this that I believe that scoring based on farms, and not on cities, is inferior. It makes no sense that in one game, a city surrounded by only one farm could give three points to a farmer, but in another game, a similarly-sized city could give many more points due to divided farms. The farmers should be fighting over the cities, and not just the fields.

Respuesta 13:
so you don't like that you can screw people out of points? and you don't like the added tension of trying to control your farms?

Also, here's another thought. yes you might lose 3 points, but i bet your farm just got bigger which means more area to control with a 2 farmer farm. Its a double edged sword to contect a player's farms like that because they may become too powerful.

I think its a blast to try and score off the same city a whole bunch of times. I like that you get rewarded for creative placement of tiles.

A common strategy for me is to try and get my opponents to build cities in a straight line so that i can place farmers on both sides and score tons of points.

Its neat that you have to be mindful of where cities are started and how many are clustered together.

and its easier to explain.

its a win win in my book.

Exactly. Any argument based around "Edition X scores more than edition Y" is irrelevant. You have plenty of other ways to score points, so weight your meeple placement according to whatever scoring method you use. Personally, I find 3rd edition to be so much simpler and more consistent with the rest of the rules that I would always play with that. But I wouldn't argue that it's better or worse in terms of the mechanics or how the scores work out - it's simply a bit different than playing with 1st edition scoring.

Yes, I can agree to that. But 3rd edition still has an inherent means of keeping track of what has been scored (more important with more expansion tiles in the game, maybe irrelevant with just the base game) and the fact the expansions were designed with these in mind.

So while the mechanics and scoring might be neglible, the side benefits are what make 3rd edition "better."

They are buried in the Files section...trying to find one now.

Two changes from 1st edition to 3rd (I know of no one who uses 2nd edition):

1) All cities and pennants score 2-point per tile (even the 2-tile cities). Of course, other rules still apply which may change this value (cathedrals, for example)

2) Control of a farm is determined at the end of the game. Control goes to the player with the most farmers (all players awarded the same amount of points if tied). For every completed city that borders your farm, score 3 points. Each field is scored once. Cities may be scored multiple times if they touch multiple farms.

That could be misinterpreted, so I'll clarify that ColtsFan76's remark about 2 points per tile applies only to completed cities; the end-of-game value of uncompleted cities is still 1 point per tile plus pennant bonuses.

Respuesta 19:
Thanks. Yes, it is completed city.

Uncompleted cities are still 1-point per tile and pennant (again, subject to change with Cathedrals and other expansion effects) and therefore the exact same between the two editions.

I'd say that was good play by blue to notice that. Each play is about maximizing your score and minimizing the other player's (or players', depending on the number of players).

So, if you don't like that play, how do you feel about blue placing a tile that means red can't complete his city because the required tile is already played? Defensive play, i.e. playing a tile that reduces your opponent's score or prevents a scoring opportunity, is a critical element of Carc, in my view. One that I learned the hard way on BSW!

Just to pop up… the 3e rules do not only affect the farmers? You mean a 2-tile "egg town" is worth 4 points in the 3rd edition rules? I've seen some people decidedly refute that. Can someone clarify by refering to the rulebook?

I run by 1e farmer rules. I agree the 3e is much simpler. For certain scoring situations, 1e is weird. For some other, 3e is weird. The tactics differ. I use 1e out of 2 reasons: My weird "sense of order" thinks that it's more "logical" scoring per town (though applying logic is weird in the first place). The second reason is that I prefer when the edge-farmers are able to compete with the farmers on the other side of the town.

I'll play 3e rules if the group wishes to, but I tend to prefer 1e.

Difficult, because it depends which edition rulebook
Seriously, the small city rule isn't even mentioned in 3e rules, becuase it was an exception in 1e rules. If all cities work the same way, there's no need to mention it at all.

And anyone who claims to be playing 3e but still uses the small city rule is actually playing house rules. Nothing wrong with that. Just not 3e (the point being that only someone who used to play 1e would ever consider keeping the small city rule in 3e).

As far as a proof is concerned, this is a translation from an FAQ on the official site:

'Small city' rule revoked: A ‘small city’ of only two segments now scores 2 points per tile, just like any other completed city; that is, it now scores 4 points altogether, as opposed to the original score of just 2 points.

Tema 418: Which scoring rules does the Xbox version use?
Pregunta:
Can anybody here tell me whether the Xbox version of this game uses the 1st or 3rd edition rules when it comes to scoring farms? Or second edition for that matter. Also, while I'm at it, does it count 2 tile cities as 2 points or 4? Thanks in advance.

Respuesta 1:
I don't own it, but played it with Doug Garrett (Garrett's Games & Geekiness podcast) - it toggles between scoring variations.

Respuesta 2:
It has both versions available. You can actually turn them all on/off separately so you could have a 2 square city be 2 points while fields are 3 per city.

I hadn't owned Carcassonne very long when the XBL version came out so that's where I learned that there were changes in scoring. I didn't know exactly what they were until I found a thread here explaining the difference. I wonder why Rio Grande is sticking with the old version? Doesn't really matter I guess.

By default it uses 3rd edition scoring. That means 3 points for each city a field touches (even 2-tile ones) and a 2-tile city scores 4 points.

Respuesta 5:
Ok, so it looks at who has the most farmers on a farm and awards the 3 points per completed city by default. That's what I was after. It's cool that it gives you options though, although I'm sure as somebody said, that for most people they stick on the default. That's ok as IMHO the 3rd edition is the superior version.

Respuesta 6:
The in-game labels for the rule versions are 'International' and 'US': the 3rd ed./Hans farm scoring rules are 'International' and the 1st ed./Rio Grande rules are 'US'. The same dichotomy applies to city scoring as well.

As per Huntington's post, 'International' is the default setting for both...

For ranked matches you don't have the option: it always uses 'International' scoring.



Tema 419: End Scoring - What is a "segment"?
Pregunta:
In the 3rd edition rules which we use, the end game scoring says that, for cities, roads and cloisters, players get one point per segment. I thought this meant:

Scenario #1:

Player has partial city/road with two tiles but one meeple. Tile that does not have the meeple has a pennant. Player scores three points.

Scenario #2:

Player has cloister that has three of the eight surrounding "spaces" occupied. Player scores four points.

Is this correct?

Respuesta 1:
Correct, except:

- No pennants on roads, so if the first example is the road, 2 points.
- Assumes no Inns on the road, or Cathedrals in the city - if there are, no points.

Ian

Respuesta 2:
Hmm, seems 'yes' to me.

I'm not clear as to why you would think otherwise. Although upon re-reading the rules text on final scoring there is sloppy wording which could imply scoring is done by segment not by tile. The attached graphic to the rules shows the final scoring is actually by tile (the same as during the preceeding gameplay).

I'm assuming that in Scenario #1 the meeple is a knight and Scenario #2 there is a meeple placed on the cloister as a monk.

A segment is defined on the first page of the rulebook under 'Contents', and shown in the graphics (city segment, field segment, road segment). The graphics define segments more than the written text. Basically in the game there are tiles which each contain segments of city, road, field. Note that scoring is done by tile not by segments, see the rule sections on 'completed roads', 'completed city', and 'completed cloister'. To quote the rules: 'count the number of tiles; separate segments on a tile count just once'.

Tema 420: Rivers and U-turns
Pregunta:
I've been playing Carc for a couple months now and I really like it. My extended family enjoys it too, so when we visit it's always one of the games I bring.

I like starting with the river and have recently purchased the river II expansion. We just played last night with both rivers and it's uncanny that every time Mrs. sigtaulefty picks a water curve, she wants to U-turn. I'll tell her she can't and she'll complain and ask why. I tell her it's the rules and that by u-turning you may end up stalling the river because of city tiles that have been laid - is there any other real reason for no u-turns?

Tema 421: Question about the Merchant (Wagon)
Pregunta:
When a city or road that is claimed by the Merchant is completed, the Merchant can move to an unclaimed, incomplete connected road or city. For my question, assume my Merchant is currently in a city. If I complete the city with a tile including a gated road that also completes the newly connected road, can I move the merchant to the newly complete road and get the points for that as well?

As a second question, similar start. The piece completing the city has a gated road AND another (unconnected) city section. The road doesn't connect to anything else at this time. Can add a meeple to claim the new city section and move the Merchant to the road, resulting in two pieces on the same piece?

Respuesta 1:
Answer to the first situation: No, you cannot do it twice in one move. This is same as how you cannot, with a depleted supply of Followers, complete a Road to claim the Follower and immediately place that same Follower on the Cloister you just placed.

I don't know about the second case, however.

About the third case: Considering Abbey & Mayor is a supplement of Carcassonne and the expansions can be added in any combination, it is easier to handle it all in one place. Especially if people that know the answer don't bother to visit the lesser-used subset forums.

Respuesta 2:
Right game, but more appropriately placed on the expansion link.

Regardless, I am not 100% certain on the answer. We discussed this before without any ringing endorsements.

It seems fairly clear to me that a Wagon cannot move to a completed feature regardless if it is completed simultaneously with the feature that is occupied by the wagon. In order to get the points out of it the way you intend, you would have to place the tile, place a meeple on the tile with the road closing, score the road, score the city, and then move the wagon if possible.

As to your second example, if I follow, you can claim the new city on the recently placed tile with another meeple. Since the previous city was closed, you can move the Wagon to the road if the road is still open. This will allow you to have 2 meeples on the same tile.

Two meeples on the same tile is not a violation of the rules - placing 2 meeples on the same tile is - but in this case one is being placed from supply and the other is being moved - similar to the Count moving meeples from the City to the features before scoring.

Thanks for all the input. (I couldn't remember which set the Merchant was from).

The link to CarcassonneCentral.com summed it up best for question 1: All points are scored and then the wagon moves. It didn't address snagging the extra completed road specifically, but the sentence was answer enough.

On question 2, I agree with the point that placing a meeple and moving the wagon is different than placing two meeple. The rules state that you cannot have another figure on the same feature as the wagon. It doesn't say anything about the same tile. Unless otherwise countered, we will allow this move in our games (as rare as it may be).

Thanks again.

The link to CarcassonneCentral.com summed it up best for question 1: All points are scored and then the wagon moves. It didn't address snagging the extra completed road specifically, but the sentence was answer enough.
Right. The implication there is that the completed city and the completed road are both scored at the same time. Since no one is on the road, it "scores zero." When it comes time for the Wagon to move, the road is then completed and not a viable option for the wagon.



Tema 422: What constitutes a field?
Pregunta:
I just got the game this weekend and am a bit confused on a couple of issues. The main issue being what constitutes a field. On certain pieces of the city tiles the road runs very close to the city. If a road is built along this small gap and never closed off will this make one large field or is that small gap considered closed next to the city? Not entirely sure and have not seen this issue brough up in the forums.

Respuesta 1:
If that gap is green, it's connected to the green around it. The only time a road actually ends a field area is if it ends at a gate, goes under a bridge, or ends at an intersection.

Thanks George.



Tema 423: Scoring Footballs (Two-Tile Cities)
Pregunta:
There's a lot of discussion here about 1st versus 3rd edition rules for farms. But what about the 1st versus 3rd edition rules for scoring two-tile cities (i.e. footballs). The 1st edition rules count them as 2 points; the 3rd edition rules count them as 4 points. I am used to the 1st edition (Rio) rules. Making footballs worth 4 points seems to encourage their construction (as opposed to the 1st ed. rules that encourage larger castles). The 3rd edition rules would also seem to encourage more cities generally (esp. footballs) which would make the farmers more valuable. And all of this seems to contribute to the underpowered nature of roads.

What are peoples' thoughts on this? Anyone play with 3rd edition rules BUT still count footballs as 2 points?

Respuesta 1:
I think there are 2 reasons that 3rd edition removed this rule. The obvious one is the ease of scoring and keeping it uniform.

The rule was orignally there to discourage small cities but I think moreso because the pieces were very limited. There weren't many "cap" pieces to close out cities. But with the introduction of more expansions and more unique pieces, the fear of having nothing but football cities and unplayable city tiles has diminished.

So I think this is the second reason why the rules is gone and it is safe to play 3rd edition rules completely.

Respuesta 2:
I'm confused between 1st edition Rio Grande, 1st edit something else, and 3rd edition. All I know is the way I was taught, them football cities (of only 2 tiles) are worth 4pts the way I played. When I host Carc games on BSW (online play), I set the option for old rules for cites worth 4pts concerning farming. Dunno if things changed for football cities or other cities. 1st off, if I ever decide to get more into Carc, I'll ask just what counts as adjacent to a farmer. Then I'll also ask hey players score farms + football cities and other cities.... like when one clarifies house rules with games like Settlers Of Catan where there are quite a lot of them.

Respuesta 3:
I haven't read the 3e rules, so I might be misunderstanding heter, but during the discussions regarding 1e and 3e farmer scoring, I have got the disctinct impression that there is a mix-up what is farmer scoring and what is city-scoring.

As far as I know, footballs score 2 points in any version, when built. The difference lies instead on what points they gain when the farmers score.

To answer your direct question, I score 2 points for footballs. When the farmers score, I have a fun time counting both 1e and 3e score… just to see if I can find a game where the ranking would differ depending on scoring type.

Respuesta 4:
We always play 3e rules. We abandoned the 1e rules after the fourth play. It just didn't feel right and 3e did.

From what I'm aware of, only the American Rio Grande Games edition is shipping with the 1e ruleset. Please correct me if I'm wrong. They're either too lazy or don't want to spend the money to retranslate and reprint. That's a shame, in my opinion.

With 1e, cities score 2 points per tile unless they're only 2-tiles, in which case they only score 1 per tile. With 3e, city scoring is always 2 points per tile (Note this point value in either case may be otherwise modified by a cathedral or katharer seige.) Does this make people want to build more football shaped 2-tile cities? Yes and no. We also play with King & Scout, which encourages players to build the biggest city possible.

Ultimately, though, there is a question of farming. Smaller cities will gain a farmer more points. Someone going for a lot of farming points will naturally want to build a lot of small football shaped 2-tile cities regardless of the rules editions being used. So, in my opinion, it ultimately doesn't matter how many points they're worth. I see players finishing small cities like this all the time without claiming the points (because they want to place a meeple farmer instead.)

Then we come to farm scoring. In 1e, a farmer scores 4 points per completed city on the board. Each city may only be counted once. In 3e, a farmer scores 3 points per completed city. Each individual farmer may only service a city once, but each city may be serviced by multiple farmers. (Again, note this point value may be modified by a pig, pig farm or katharer seige.) In my opinion, the 3e rules encourages stronger competition between players on who owns which farm fields, rather than who services which city. This mirrors and encourages continuity in the theme of competition over cities and roads, whereas I do not feel the 1e rules do the same. The 1e rules seem to encourage people fighting over servicing specific cities.

Overall, I believe the 3e rules are more true to the game and more elegant. The themes are continuous instead of scattered and it keeps everyone on track. The ease in scoring is another bonus, but not the main point of the rewrite. The author, to my knowledge, stands by his rules updates. It's a pity the American publishers don't follow his lead.

From what I recall, Jay of RGG feels that 1st Edition was what won the SdJ award and that is what he should keep. However, with each release of new expansions, it gets harder and harder to maintain a split on the scoring. It is probably causing him more work to change the rules to fit his antiuated system. I think he missed a prime opportunity to get everyone on the same page when the Big Box came out. Enough subtle changes were released int he rules that he could have taken advantage of that and ditched 1st edition once and for all.

As to the others, the farming rules are the main point of contention between the two editions. Because of that, this scoring switch on small cities is often overlooked in the discussions.

Hypothetically, it would follow from this that if Carcassonne hadn't won the SdJ award, Jay might be more amenable to updating the rules. And from this it would follow that winning the SdJ was, at least for the American audience, to the detriment of the game: it turned it into a museum piece, a relic for which preservation in an artificial chronology is more important than the actual enjoyment of the players. This isn't a game we're talking about, but a piece of history.

So I don't really buy the SdJ argument. No, I think there's a much darker purpose at work here.

Respuesta 8:
I learned Carc and continue to play most of my Carc on AsoBrain. Naturally, the rules they use make sense to me - 2 points rather than 4 for 2-tile cities (1st edition rules), and farmers score 3 points per city (3rd edition).

The only reason I can see for giving 4 points to a 2-tile city is to make the rules even simpler. For me, they're plenty simple as it is and giving 4 points for a 2-tile city is too much of a luck reward. "Oh look, I pulled a cap! Automatic no-risk 4 points for me!"

As for how this rule affects the farmer strategy, I'm not so sure it really does (for me, anyhow, as someone who approaches Carc competitively). I go into every game with the intention of winning the farming war, it doesn't matter to me if the biggest farm ends up having 4 or 8 or 12 cities.

Don't get me wrong. I think the SdJ argument is weak. But it is the reason I most often hear as to why Jay would keep the rules.

What else could be the reason? Translation is cheap. Or, re-translating the original would have been cheaper the re-writing all the expansions. Pride? I guess that could play into it. Perhaps it is to give RGG credence as its own publsihing house instead of just an arms dealer between the german designers and the english-speaking world?

All weak arguments. Which makes it all the more frustrating.

Respuesta 11:
As I understood it, the true "SdJ argument" is this: If any rules are changed whatsoever from the version that won the SdJ, it means the SdJ people won't allow their logo to appear on the box. Which theoretically could affect sales, though less so in countries that aren't Germany I guess.

Respuesta 12:
I used to play 3rd edition rules with 1st edition two tile city (football) scoring, but later changed to the more uniform 3rd edition scoring completely. I prefer the 3rd edition rules, and in our games it has not affected the amount of two tiled cities appearing. Of course, everyone has that same advantage so does not really affect overall strategy and gameplay.
With regards to the SdJ argument. I too feel it's a weak one. In any case, RGG have had the hard work done for them with regards to the translating. Matt Harper's Completley Annotated Rules is an excellent resource. Perhaps RGG could talk to Matt Harper and have his CAR bundled with the game!

But his customers miss some of the confusion we have here in germany.

When casual players from different groups meet to play, they might not be aware that there are several editions of the rules. Each one thinks the rules that came with their copy of the game are the real ones, and is surprised when during the game (or in the scoring on the end of the game) other players have different opinions who gets what points.

In addition, there is a good number of people who own a 1st or 2nd edition game. When they bought the Traders & Builders expansion, the rule examples for the farms won't make much sense to them; aside from the fact that the pig increases the value of cities by 1, from 4 (their base game) to 4 (expansion rule).

Tema 424: bridges/pastures
Pregunta:
Most fields do not continue under bridges. If the "green" is literally divided, then so is the field.

As a contrast, the "green" continues around most tunnels so in those cases the field continues on as well.

Most of the expansion rules will clearly state questionable tiles at the very end. If you know which tile it is and which expansion, you should be able to look it up.

I don't like the score card. It only goes up to 50. My question is how do you keep track of how many times you've gone around it? At one point I almost got lapped by the other player.

First way: You can turn a meeple that has exceeded 50 points upside down, so he stands on his head-and-shoulder. If he goes over 100, you can lay him down like a farmer.

Second way: You can buy the Inns & Cathedrals expansion, which includes, among other things, tiles that say "50" on one side and "100" on the other.

There ought to be "+50" tiles which you receive when you gone around, the backside reading "+100" for cycling the score track twice.

Hey, that's my kitchen table!

Anyway, the +50/+100 are included in the Inns & Cathedrals (or was it Traders & Builders?). You won't find it in the base game.

With just the base game, keeping your meeple standing up until you lap 50 works and then lay them down for count up to 100. With just the basic game, you should be hard pressed to get over 100 points. If you do, then let them do handstands.

The scoring cube is a neat idea.

If you're just going to be playing mostly with 2-3 players, though, you can pass out extra 50/100 tiles as needed. There are 6 such tiles included with the game. In a 2-player game, that means you can get scores as high as 349 each without needing extra components, and 249 for the 3-player game. That's definitely more than sufficient for nearly any permutation of expansions you could come up with.

Respuesta 9:
Pen and paper.

This solves two problems:

1.) You can't accidentally hit the "Paper" with your elbow, causing the "score" to suddenly move across the scorecard
2.) You get an extra meeple (normally used for keeping score) to get more points

I don't use the score-card any more. Its a nice little edition to the game, but completely worthless.

We just tried the expansion, Traders and Builders, and one guy went around twice. We stacked another meeple on top of the original meeple, and this acts as a handicap for this fellow in the lead (as I screamed "NEW HOUSE RULE").

In answer to your question: Yes, you can leave holes anywhere you like. You can even leave holes that make it impossible for a tile to be placed there. However, each new tile played must be played adjacent to an existing tile, so you can't just float a tile away from the rest.

About leaving an empty spot in the middle of the board. Yes, this is legal. There is nothing wrong with having "Gaps". Some times they are unavoidable where there are no legal tiles that will fit in that spot. The expansions have helped eliminated most of the cases of this with special tiles, but it still occurs when all potential tile placements for such a spot are used up.

This can also be part of a strategy. if your opponent is working on a castle (lets say) you can place tiles near his castle that would make it difficult if not impossible to finish, because the necessary piece to finish is either rare, or non existant.

Tema 427: Carcassone Scoring Question
Pregunta:
When scoring farms, if two farmers owned by the same player in two different fields supply the same city, does that player score twice for that city(8 points)?

Respuesta 1:
No - each city is only worth 4 for whichever player gets the score

Respuesta 2:
Well, I think this actually depends on which farm-scoring version you USE. There are 3 official ways to score farms, and it's all quite confusing

You'd probably have better luck in the Carcassonne forum instead of the general forum here - I'm sure all farming methods are described therein.

Respuesta 3:
There are 2 ways to score farms. However, in either case, the number of meeples only determines the majority; they do not multiple out to give you more points.

So, if you are using the rules straight out of the box (assuming since you are from the US and own Rio Grande games version), then you are using what is called first edition rules. In that case, each city is only worth 4 points but those 4 points are only awarded to the person who has the most meeples in fields adjacent to that city. If no other players had any meeple in fields adjacent othat city, you get 4 points. If others only have 1 in that field, you still get 4 points. If someone else has 2 meeples, then you each get 4 points. If someone has 3 meeples, then they get the 4 points and you get nothing.

If you want to join the majority of people who use the ruleset from Hans im Gluck (the original publisher), then you would use 3rd edition rules. That says you determine the majority in the fields, then see how many completed cities are touching that field. For each completed city, you get 3 points. Same general principle though, your 2 meepls only count towards the majority and not mulitpliers to the score. So no matter how many meeples you have, you still only get 3 points per city.

@ColtsFan76

Unless, as he described in his question, the two farmers are in two completely separate fields. Then, under the newer and preferred rules, you would receive 3 points for the city for each field.

Tema 428: Question about fields on the 'X' tile - are they connected?
Pregunta:
Hi. The base Carcassonne set includes a tile with 4 disconnected road segments (each segment begins near the center of the tile and extends to an edge of the tile). On the big-box tile sheet is is labeled as 'X'. The 4 roads running N, S, W, E create what appear to be 4 separate fields, one in each corner. However, looking closely at the center of the tile, between the buildings, it appears that at least some of the fields are connected (maybe 3 of the 4?)

We've been treating this tile as 4 disconnected fields, but now I'm wondering if some or all are connected. Anybody know?

The rules indicate that you can't have two pieces occupying the same segment of a city (or road or farmland)
no matter how far away the other tile.

So how can you then end up with 2 pieces in a city (or r or fl)? Clearly you can since points are scored that way.

Can there be different segments of a city and if so what makes them separate segments of a city?

Confused....


Thanks.


Mark

Respuesta 1:
The rules shouldn't say that you can't have two pieces in the same city, just that you can't place a second piece into a city that already has one. The difference is that one person can have a piece on one city tile that still has open edges, and a second person can place a piece on a separate city tile with open edges - (at this point the city portions of the two tiles are not connected) - then someone can play a tile that connects the two pieces of city into the same city, and then the two pieces end up in the same city.

This can happen with different players, or the same player can use this technique to double up the number of pieces he has in a city to convince someone else not to waste time trying to get in to the city unless he can do it with two pieces, or to answer a city invasion that has already happened. If you have two pieces and an opponent has only one, then you alone get the score. (This is often important with fields.)

Respuesta 2:
As an Example:
I start a city by putting one of my meeples on a city tile,
you start a city by putting one of your meeples on a different city tile.

As we play the game, our cities expand with more and more tiles being added to our individual cities. Eventually, our cities are close enough together that I can place a city tile that connects our two cities together as one large city. At that point, we each have a meeple in the single large city that results.

The same can happen for a road, or a farmland.

You start a road, I start a road, and the two roads eventually connect to become one road.

etc.

I think the rule means you cannot place a meeple on a road (or in a city) for which I already have clear ownership.

mikey.



Tema 430: What happens when builder gets left alone???
Pregunta:
We often have a situation that occurs when playing with the builder along with either the Dragon OR the tower expansions, in which a city or road is built with the weeple and builder, then by either a dragon movement or a capture by tower, the weeple is removed, but the builder is left in the city/road.

Can someone clarify the rules in this situation. I believe the builder/pig is left on it's tile as is, and simply useless to the player until they either reclaim their city/road/farm or it is killed off by the dragon or someone else completes the city/road.

Respuesta 1:
That's just the way we play it. I agree, the rules often don't cover interactions between expansions.

Yes, the new Big Box rules state that when a builder/pig are left alone with no other "supporting" meeple of that color, they are returned to the player's supply. Pigs/builders can't exist on their own, so when their "sponsor" is gone, so are they.

Thanks Tom,

Still a bit confused as a newbie to the game. If I just bought this game, should it have not shipped with the latest (3rd edition) of the rules? Does anyone have a link to the 3rd edition rules? What is the concensus here on BGG as to which rules to use?

Respuesta 3:
The german publisher (Hans im Glück) revised the rules.
The US publisher (Rio Grande Games) kept the 1st edition rules.

Use whatever rules you like, but be sure the whole group knows what rules to use.

Carcassone Field Scoring Rules Update
You have several errors in here. What is your source?

The different points for completed 2 tiles cities are for the player scoring the city, not the farmers supplying it. It is 4 in the 3rd edition rules.

The farmer rules for 2nd and 3rd edition rules are identical, except in 2nd edition you could only get the points for a city once, even if you have the majority in several fields. In 3rd, you may score a city from several fields.

4 points per city for the farmers, regardless the size of the city, is 1st edition rules.

The size of the city only makes a difference for knights scoring the city. In this case, the rules differ regarding the value of 2 tiles cities.

I guess it does not make much of a difference to me as long as I stay consistent. Both rules seem reasonable enough.

Respuesta 10:
Still have to say that 2e farmer scoring seems to be the worst case. I agree it's easier to score if you just count the farmers in the fields (as opposed to "farmers connected with this city") but it seems even more a fight for the fields which will make each field even more worth, making everything rely on that field.

Then again, I have probably not played enough to comment…

But as I have the 1e rules, I can confirm that the "2 points for a 2 tile city" is when you score the city as it's completed, When you score farmers, it still counts as a full city (4 points).

Indeed. I haven't tried it yet, but I think the best way would be a mix of first and third edition scoring. You would score like in the first edition, but only 3 points per city, instead of 4. I like the first edition rule because each city only scores once.

I have to agree.

This phrase:
Quote:
COMPLETED CITIES made up of only two tiles are worth 2 pts instead of 4.
has nothing to do with farmer scoring at all. It refers to the scoring of "small" (two-tile) cities throughout the game.

Therefore this sentence:
Quote:
*There is no longer a distinction about cities made up of 2 tiles. ALL CITIES are now worth 3 points.
is completely meaningless.

Respuesta 15:
A single farm worth six points? is that much?

I fail to see how farms score extremely more with the 1e rules. I mean, in 1e, you can have competitors for each city from fields on the other side of the city, dividing those points, right? Or do you mean the difference in points alone? (3 or 4)?

I meant numbers alone. I don't think that the first edition does a better job to divide points for farmers, I think that it's the opposite if anything. It's a matter of perspective of course. It's only a difference of one point per city but more cities make it more lucrative. The numbers would be extreme if someone manages to have many cities that each score six points because of expansions.

Exactly that.

The first edition farm rules are cumbersome, because you are scoring the farms from a city's perspective, which makes less sense than scoring them from the FARM's perspective (as in the 3rd ed. on). So a city can score for multiple farms connected to it.

Also, the RGG Abbey and Mayor rules clearly speak of the farms from a 3rd/4th scoring system.

As well as Travel Carcassonne...

Is this sarcasm? Six points for a one of seven meeples you cannot move throughout the game is completely worthless. You can score six points on a quick 3 tile city and have your meeple back.

My rules state 4 points per city a players farmer(s) "control(s)" (farm connects to that city), and you only score a city once. Last game I scored 28 points on a very large farm I had 2 farmers on. This isn't unbalancing thought IMO as it's easy enough to add farmers to a large farm through tile placement and negate your opponents farms.

Not sure what set of rules I have but after reading the posts here I like the rules I have best (2 tile cities are also worth 2 points, not 4).

Sort of... The current US version uses the German first edition farm scoring rules (as well as the first edition 2-tile city rules). Rio Grande has said that they don't like updating rules, as it creates confusion.

However, Abbey and Mayor expansion refers to the current (3rd/4th edition German) farm scoring rules. Check out M. Haper's annotated rules here in the files section for a very good resource.

Tema 432: River Tiles in Basic Box

There are no instructions on the use of the river tiles, and I was wondering if someone could tell me how I should be using them. Do I start with the river tiles, and if so do I shuffle them or start them in a certain order. Are there any sites which offer tips on how to play for beginners? Maybe a video of people playing?

I do believe they're in there somewhere. IIRC, it might just have been as a sidebar to the main rules. Anyway, it's pretty simple...

You've got two end pieces to the river - the spring and the lake. Set those aside. Then separate the rest of the river tiles from the other tiles you're using and shuffle/mix them. The spring is the starting tile and the first player takes a random river piece and plays onto that, playing meeples on features as usual. Play continues as usual drawing only from the river tiles until they're gone, finishing with the lake. Play then continues using the rest of the tiles.

The only other rule is that if there are two 90 degree river bends drawn in a row then they can't be played as a 180 bend - they have to form a "jog" instead. This is only because you might then be forced into having adjacent river tiles that don't have matching sides.

Tema 433: Question about BUILDERS
Pregunta:
I posted this on the Traders and Builders forum, but after the fact, I was thinking the main Carc forum might get more traffic, so I'm placing the same question here too... So forgive the double thread.
____________________________________________________________________________
I have a question about builders.

If your builder is placed on a road for example and your opponent continues the road or completes the road. Obviously you score the road if its completed, but does the builder lose his ability to select another tile. My interpretation of the rules is the owner of the builder must complete or continue to qualify for the 2nd tile pull. Is that correct?

So if your opponent just continues the road or city does the builder go back into your meeple supply or does he stay there until you place a tile to gain his bonus tile? What say you fellow BGG'ers?

Respuesta 1:
Once the road/city is complete, you get all your meeples back - including the builder. The special ability of the Builder only grants an additiona turn when it happens on your own turn.

Nothing special happens when your opponet extands your road/city with your builder present.

Respuesta 2:
Whenever YOU add to the city/road where YOUR Builder is placed YOU draw and place a bonus tile.

Even if the bonus tile is added to the city/road where your Builder is do you NOT get a second bonus tile. It only works once per turn.

You get the bonus tile even you close the road/city. The bonus is triggered when you place the tile, and at that time was the Builder still on the road/city.

No-none gets a bonus tile for adding a tile to a city/road of with a Builder belonging to ANOTHER player.

If someone else closes your road/city will you SCORE the points for that city/road, whereafter you get your Meeple(s) and Builder back.
You don't get a bonus tile because you didn't place the first tile!

Respuesta 3:
As stated, only you gain the bonus for your builder. The builder is not affected by tiles played by other players, unless they complete the feature, in which case the builder is removed. The builder remains on the board until the feature is removed -- you get a bonus tile every time you place a tile (except for a bonus tile) on that feature -- not just the first time.

Respuesta 4:
Interesting. To reiterated your reponses, the builder stays on the road or city until it is finished and every tile placed by the builder's owner gets the bonus tile. Correct?

My wife and I have been playing where the opponent can cancel the other player's builder by placing the next tile. The builder goes back to its owner's meeple supply... So from what I'm gathering we have been playing wrong.

For the sake of game discussion, when a builder is placed, there is no way to conteract the builder unless you(as the opponent) completes the road or city?

Respuesta 5:
Correct, there is no way to counteract the builder when he is placed. But also realize you do not get the bonue the first turn that the builder is placed. It is every subsequent turn that the feature is expanded that a 2nd tile and turn may be taken.

Respuesta 6:
Patiently waiting for the zombie apocalypse...
@CM Randall

You can also counteract the builder by making the city or road impossible to complete, thus stranding the figure in the incomplete feature.

Respuesta 7:
Excellent point. Blocking the builder so he is stuck is obviously a little more devious but more effective in taking care of him.

I've not played Carc with more than three, but I can imagine the builder in a 4 to 5 player game is quite powerful.



Tema 434: Knight Placement Question
Pregunta:
Hello all!

Our first post here on BGG! Hope someone can help!

Just got Carcassonne recently and are struggling with a basic rule - placing knights in cities.

I suppose the question is really "When is a city not the same city?"

Say a knight is placed on a city section, another player plays another city section next to it, either above, below or on the diagonal (obviously only if there is another tile placed to allow this) where the city sections only meet at the corner - is this classed as the same city?

Obviously, it isn't actually decided until a third tile is placed - someone can close off either or both cities with certain tiles, or place a tile which proves they form part of the same city. So - whats the rule? Are they separate cities until the third tile is played? (Meaning the player that plays the second city section can place a knight on it) Or are they classed as the same city, because the tiles are next to each other and there is a corner-corner join, until proven otherwise, meaning the player playing the second tile cannot play a knight.

Would have been much easier to ask this question by showing you tile layouts, but hope it makes sense!

thanks in advance for any advice!

Darren

Respuesta 1:
Cities that only meet at a corner aren't connected. If they were, it'd be much harder to steal cities from other players.

For example, there are three separate 2-tile cities above the flower in this picture:


And without the tile to the left of the pendant city tile, this would be two incomplete cities:

Respuesta 2:
Features are never connected diagonally. Only directly adjacent tiles can connect features.

No. It is never certain that they are the same city, until they are actually connected by another tile.

Respuesta 3:
Place your finger on a city in question. Wherever you can trace your finger inside the city walls without lifting it, is part of the same city. If they're only connected at the corner, then they are not the same city until connected on the flat adjacent sides.

This is part of the city-stealing strategy. Say your opponent places a tile with a city on it, and they put a knight in the city. You can tie or steal their city by putting one of your knight in their city. The rules forbid you from putting a knight in a city that already has a knight. So in order to do this, you would place another city tile nearby but not touching their city (such as the corner), and put a knight in it. Then when you get a piece that connects the two cities, you now share the city. If you have an expansion that has a Double Follower, or a Mayor, you can actually steal the city from them, or if you manage to get two knights from two cities connected to their city (but that is a bit more difficult, though not impossible).

I hope that helps.

Enjoy the Crusades!



Tema 435: Many rule clarifications
Pregunta:
Hi all, we just had our second 'UberCarc' session last night in which we played with all of the expansions we had to hand (River I, River II, King & Scout, The Count of Carcassonne, Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, The Tower, Princess & Dragon, Abbey & Mayor). 6 hours!

With all the possible permutations and interactions that you start having to think about, a set of questions arose that we didn't have answers to and which didn't tend to arise in 'normal' play. I've listed them here if anyone can help with the answers (with our interpretations in brackets):

1. When you move a wagon from one feature to another, does the features just need to be just on the same tile, or physically connected? (physically connected)

2. If the latter, can you use a cloister tile with multiple road exits to complete one road and move to the other road, or does the cloister separate them? (the cloister separates them)

3. Can you use a tile to complete an unclaimed feature, use a wagon to claim and immediately score for that feature, then move it to another adjacent unclaimed fetaure? (yes, the wagon is moved as part of the scoring phase, and is therefore separate from the 'move the wood' phase)

4. In the city-road-city-road-with-junction piece from Inns and Cathedrals, are the two roads connected to the two cities for the purpose of moving the wagon? (yes, since the two little 'roads' aren't really roads which separate anything)

5. When moving a wagon to an adjacent unclaimed feature, can you select any tile within that feature to avoid towers or the dragon? (yes, since the wagon is already allowed to travel across several tiles to reach a connecting feature, e.g. a cloister at the far end of a long road)

6. If the placement of a dragon tile extends a feature containing a builder, and then the dragon eats that builder, does the player still get their extra draw? (yes, the extra go has already been triggered before the dragon moves)

7. Can you then extend that same feature with your extra go and put the builder back in again? (yes, natural extension of the rules)

8. Can you use a magic gate to teleport a follower into an uncompleted feature on a tile which contains the fairy? (yes, the rules don't seem to prevent this)

9. Is the fairy then associated with the teleported follower, and thus award bonus points? (no, fairies need to be associated with specific followers for the purpose of scoring; they're only associated with the whole tile for preventing the movement of the dragon)

10. If you teleport into an uncompleted feature on a tile already containing both a fairy and associated follower, does the fairy award bonus points to both the original follower and the teleporting follower? (no, for the same reason as above)

Respuesta 1:
1. Physically connected - the example in the rule book shows the wagon moving two hexes away as one option.

2. Cloister should separate them. If you were on the Cloister itself, and it was completed, then you could go to any of the roads from there.

3. Yes. This appears to be the sequence - place tile, place wagon, score, move wagon. This is going to make those "garbage" 2-tile features more interesting if something is connected to them and your wagon is available.

4. Are you talking about the tile in the bottom right corner?

Not sure. The "2 little roads" aren't roads as you say but just one intersection. So each road should be connected with the other and the two towns as well. So placing in either of these four locations should let you jump to the other three when that first one is completed.

5. It seems the only requirement is that the feature be connected to where you were and that it be vacant. No mention of where it needs to be placed along the feature. So I say yes as well.

6. Good question. When the dragon moves, time "stops." The normal game is interrupted to resolve the dragon. So I don't think that an extra round would be granted as the builder is gone by the time the game "starts up" again.

7. Since I don't think the tile can be placed, I don't think the builder can be redeployed on the same turn that it was eaten.

8. I am going to say no. The fairy may be deployed anywhere next to a follower. But a follower may not be deployed to a tile that is occupied.

9. I say no because of answer 8. But even if you could move the follower to the same tile, I would say no as well. The only way the fairy would be standing alone is if her associated follower left the tile because of being scored - which implies the feature was complete. If the feature is complete, another follower can't enter it through a magic gate. I guess the only other option is if a follower was seduced away from the city before the city was scored.

10. Right, the fairy is only associated with 1 follower on a tile - not the whole tile.

EDIT: Spelling

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for your prompt reply!

4. Yes, it is that tile I'm talking about.

8. That's not what the rules say, or at least not how I interpret them. It says a follower can only be deployed to an unoccupied feature. If, for example, a cloister was previously placed but the field was claimed instead of the cloister, the cloister is still unoccupied and up for grabs by a monk, even if there happens to be a farmer on that tile. If this is allowed, then tile occupation doesn't prevent teleportation to that tile, and by extension, occupation by the fairy doesn't prevent it either.

9. The fairy can also be left if the follower was taken captive by a tower. This is the situation that arose in our game. But I agree, I think you need a separate 'move the fairy' turn to associate the fairy with a teleported follower. In which case, you need a way of distinguishing between an 'associated fairy' and an 'unassociated fairy' (just a sensible grouping/separation of fairy and follower, really).

Respuesta 3:
8. Yes, you are correct. I mistyped "tile" when I meant to say "feature." However, I still believe that if the Fairy occupies a city feature on a tile, then you cannot place the follower on that same city feature. If the Fairy is on the city and you want to deploy to the road, then I think that is OK.

I may be off because the definition of followers and pieces have been redefined since the Big Box came out. What I thought I knew may no longer be accurate. But it seems to me that if the Fairy is on an feature, that feature is occupied and no follower can be placed there.

9. Yes, I forgot about the Tower. But if I am wrong about 8 above, and you can place a follower on the same feature as the fairy, then the fairy probably DOES becomes associated with that follower right then and there.

However, the bonus point would NOT be awarded at that time since the follower and fairy have to be on the feature to start the turn - not when either is just placed. (The normal 3 point bonus would still apply if the magic portal also managed to complete the feature you teleported into as well.)

Respuesta 4:
8. That's interesting. I never thought of the fairy as an 'occupying force' before. That would mean that an otherwise-unclaimed city would be prevented from being reclaimable until the fairy moved first. That makes sense to me, but I'd like to see an official ruling if there is one.

9. Yeah, I still thought that the 1 point would only be awarded on a future turn, or the 3 points only when the feature is complete. But I was questioning whether or not bonus points would be awarded at all. I'm still not convinced that the fairy is associated with a feature though, and that teleporting into a feature auto-associates the fairy with your follower. If that was the case, then you could teleport into a different tile on that feature and have the fairy's association even though they're on different tiles.

I also forgot to ask another question:

11. Can a follower be used to inhibit the creation of a tower by placing him on a tower foundation? (no, the rules seem to distinguish between 'tower' and 'tower foundation', and mention that followers can be placed on the top of *towers*, suggesting that a tower piece must be placed first before a follower can be placed)

Respuesta 5:
Quote:
8. Can you use a magic gate to teleport a follower into an uncompleted feature on a tile which contains the fairy? (yes, the rules don't seem to prevent this)
I'm going to agree with this interpretation, and in a rare move for me, disagree with coltsfan. I always understood "unoccupied" to refer to occupied by another player's piece, rather than neutral features.

And then does a fairy occupy a feature, rather than a tile? If someone has a follower on a tower and on a city in the same tile, does the fairy only protect one of the followers? Given the fact that I think the answer is that she protects both followers, I think it follows that she wouldn't prevent someone teleporting or wagoning into a fairy-occupied feature. They WANT to protect people!

Respuesta 6:
8.
The rules of the Magic gates allow the player to place a Follower on any tiles by the 'normal rules' - which mean that the 'area' chosen must be void of Followers (but not necessarily other figures) and cannot be a 'area' that has already been scored.

As the Fairy isn't a 'Follower'* is there nothing to prevent a player from placing one next to her.

*) All Followers have a player color, all the other figures are 'neutral'.

Edit: Missed an important 'not'.

Respuesta 7:
A dragon is "neutral" and devoid of a player color but prevents the placement of followers in that tile.

However, that is specifically called out for the Dragon and not the Fairy. So perhaps the placement of a follower in a feature with the Fairy is legit (as seems to be the case when you dig through all the rule references to placement). I don't disagree with the point, I am just cautious because it seems even after all the discussion of followers vs. "neutrals," they forgot to "double-check" all their terminology when Abbey and Mayor came out.

So I am in complete agreement that an "official" word would be appreciated.

9. Going back to the discussion of "association" - I see this as being a matter of "the easiset answer being the correct one." Carcassonne is not meant to be difficult (though the expansion interactions sure have created a monster!). There is no means to distiguish between associated and unassociated except the fact they are in the same feature. So if the follower can be placed in the same feature as a fairy - why give yourself the headache of trying to figure out if they are associated or not? I say just let them be!

If your fellow players don't want you to get the bonus point at the start of your turn, then they need to move the fairy on their turn. And if they didn't want you to have the 3 bonus points for completing the feature, they shouldn't have Captured/Seduced your follower. And if you did it to yourself (since I think you can now seduce yourself ((!!!)) but can't capture yourself), shame on you!

11. I would agree with your interpretation. A follower can only be placed on top of a tower piece - not the foundation. Only a tower piece can be placed on the foundation.

This is what I think. However, I was more concerned about the scoring aspects of the fairy than about protection. Obviously the whole tile is protected by the fairy, because the dragon just can't enter it while the fairy is there, even if there is a tasty-looking follower which isn't associated with the fairy on the same tile.

Can a follower teleport to be in the same tile as the fairy such that the follower becomes associated with the fairy and thus any future 1-point-per-turn and 3-points-on-feature-completion bonus points are awarded without the fairy having been touched?

A dragon is "neutral" and devoid of a player color but prevents the placement of followers in that tile.
I think that's only because the dragon would instantly eat the follower. So rather than have people be pains in the rump, they decided to make that explicitly forbidden, rather than just exlplicitly pointless ;p

Can a follower teleport to be in the same tile as the fairy such that the follower becomes associated with the fairy and thus any future 1-point-per-turn and 3-points-on-feature-completion bonus points are awarded without the fairy having been touched?
I would think so, myself.

Tema 437: First Game For Me AND My 6-Year-Old
Pregunta:
I'm an avid gamer who likes to buy games my daughter can play with me (she is 6). Seeing as how many others had reported playing Carcassonne with their 6 year olds (and younger), I decided to give it a try. After a few turns, she picked up all the mechanics and played a very solid game. I helped her win some good points, and I made some mistakes myself (it WAS my first time, after all). In the end, I ended up winning by 1 point. We left out the farmer scoring (as was recommended).

I won't say I'm suprised by the strategies that became apparent as the game got longer (strategies I wasn't aware of at first), because many others have pointed out how deep the game can be. But I saw a number of places where good strategic play could have been used to great effect.

I especially liked when she drew a cloister, and found a space for a tile that was already surrounded by farms. She put the tile down and scored 9 points on that one play! She definitely liked that.

Overall, I thought it was GREAT fun. Not only did I have fun playing, my daughter did too! What a great find!

William,
Shocked! Shocked I am after a year and a half on this site and most of that time with you as a geekbuddy, to actually disagree with you on something.

Yes, this is a great game with kids (especially being able to discuss each choice as it comes up) but I believe that with (2-3) adults it is perfect. Easy to teach, intuitive to pick up but difficult to master and with, for me, just the right level of downright nastiness.

Dang, and I was about to make a post disparaging pbm, the BGG community, tufty, gnomes, and soccer. Now I've got to hold on to that thought for the next 18 months...

(I'm not sure why Cancassonne doesn't do much for me, but it doesn't. I can see the interesting parts, but somehow whenever I play I just can't get excited about it. Unless my daughter is playing with me, and that makes any game exciting!)

Thanks guys! Been a lurker for a long time, just never posted!

Answer, to your second question - try her with a couple of light games but dont push her.
If you are very lucky she will want to try one of the games again and you can gradually build her up to a full fledged gamer.
If you are averagely lucky, she will be happy to play the occasional game with you and your kid(s) as they grow up. Thank your stars that she is this willing to participate in your hobby.
If you are unlucky she will never want to play the games again. Start or join a game group.

Some people are gamers, some definitely aren't. You stand a good chance of bringing up a gamer but you will never change your wife if she falls into the latter camp, so no point causing friction. Just enjoy sharing the things you enjoy sharing and enjoy gaming as a hobby you do apart from her.

On another note, I managed to get my mother-in-law to play with me and my daughter. She and I spent the majority of our time trying to win control of a city, while my daughter kept completing things. I guess I should just learn when to give up on a city, because in the end, my daughter helped grandma and cut me off from the city completely, costing me a huge investment in points. Needless to say, grandma and granddaughter both beat me. I still have some strategy to learn...

Perhaps best of all, grandma LOVED the game. That actually suprised me, because she usually (like my wife) does not play games. She talked about it 3 more times that evening, after the game was over. In my opinion, if you are still thinking about the game hours later, you like the game. I'll definitely have to give her another chance at it!

My 6 year old daughter loves the game. We have worked out a handicap system where she currently gets a 50 point headstart. We play with both rivers and the Traders and Builders expansion and she has no difficulty with any of the mechanics and now knows how to "muscle in" on my cities.

She is now just learning how to get in on the farms as well but finds this a little harder to visualise. I occasionally help her to see some good blocking plays but generally she wants me to play as hard as I like. She hates me "letting her win".

Yesterday I found her teaching the game to a couple of her friends as well which was great to see (although I stayed to supervise i.e. keep their drinks out of reach )



Tema 438: My complete mix of rules
Pregunta:
The rules in my copy of the game states one thing while the currently official rules seems to state something else. And the rules in my base game doesn't always match with the rules in the expansions. And what about those tricky situations that arise when you play with expansions? My brain hurts!

I got tired of trying to find out which rules are "the right ones", so last night I read everything I could find about the game here and made up my own mix of rules. I want to share my rules mix with you since I'm sure that there are people who, just like me, want to play the game just for fun and want rules that make sense, even if they are not the latest official rules.

Please note that these rules are not official. Some of the rules are official, some are old rules that have changed and some are probably only my own assumptions. I have not included rules for The Cathars or Abbey & Mayor since I don't have expansions. And of course, these rules only cover some specific things, I assume people who play the game know the base rules.

First a clarification. A meeple/follower is a regular meeple or a big meeple. I have decided that the pigs and builders are not followers and that they are dependant on a follower. The big meeples are special only when determining majorities. In all other cases they are treated like regular meeples.

So, here we go:

Turn sequence:
1. Take the fairy point and buy back prisoners
2. Draw a tile and place it
3a. You may do one of the following
-place a follower on a road, in a city, on a cloister, on a field or on a tower
-place a builder or a pig on a feature you already own
-move the fairy
-place a tower block and capture one meeple (not pigs, builders or meeples on other towers)
-remove a meeple from a city if you drew a princess tile
3.b If you drew a volcano tile, then you must move place the dragon on it and you may not do any of the things mentioned above
4. The dragon moves if a dragon tile was drawn
5. Place meeples from the count's city on a feature that's about to be scored
6. Score completed features and collect tokens
7. Place meeples in the city of the count and move the count
8. If you extended a feature with your builder, draw and place a new tile

And then some other cases.
The dragon can move on any tiles except the count's city and the tile were the fairy is. The dragon eats everything. No diets here, meeples, big meeples, pigs, builders, everything goes. And the dragon can fly, so it also eats meeples on towers.
A figure can never be on the same tile as a dragon. When the dragon enters a tile, it clears it out. Figures may not be placed on the same tile as the dragon (this would only be possible using the magic gate). Pigs and builders can't use the magic gate at all, big meeples of course can.

Builders and pigs can't be alone. If the meeple that allowed you to place builder or a pig is captured, eaten by the dragon or seduced by the princess, then your builder/pig is returned to your supply.

All bridges divide fields, but not cities or roads. This means that the tricky tile in River II with a city going over the river has four fields, not two. But both the city/road that makes the bridge and cities/roads under the bridge are continued.

That should be it. I could also mention that we use what I think is called the 3rd edition field scoring. We also decided that every city is worth 3 points (4 with the pig) when scoring fields and the city of the count also counts. (It also counts when scoring the king bonus.) In addition we use the small city rule that says the small cities are only worth 2 points.

I hope this can provide help for someone, at least these rules make sense to me and my friends. After all, the game is about having fun, and arguing about rules isn't very much fun.

Respuesta 1:
My question that didn't get answered in your mix of rules is: Once you place a dragon card what happens? Do you have the opportunity to move the fairy or place a meeple before the dragon moves?

Otherwise there are some great ideas featured. I agree this game is fun and shouldn't be bogged down with rules. House rules make it exciting!

Respuesta 2:
The rules (at least in my copy of the expansion) state that you are allowed to place a follower before the dragon moves. That would mean you can do any one of the things in 3a in the turn sequence. Actually it happens quite often that when someone draws a dragon tile, they move the fairy to one of the meeples that could otherwise be eaten by the dragon.

Another thing I completely forgot to mention are pictures of pigs on to tiles, one each in the River II and the Mini expansion. The rules state that the pigs on the Mini expansion tile are a mere decoration, while the pigs on the river tile give the pig bonus to the owner of the field. Here we go against the rules and regard all pig pics as decorations. One pig per person is enough.

I'm happy if my post helps someone.



Tema 439: What is the OFFICIAL field scoring rules?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carc seems to change the rules depending on which publisher (and sometimes which print run) you happen to have on the table in front of you. My recommendation is to use what the rules in the box say, or come to mutual agreement before the tiles hit the table.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most tournaments publish the rules prior so everyone knows where they stand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sag.

Respuesta 2:
Generally you have "1st edition" scoring which is in use by Rio Grande and gives points based on "who has the most farms feeding this city" (also, 2 points for small cities) and then there's 3rd edition scoring used by the German publisher based on "which cities touch this farm?" and 4-point small cities.

I have read that 1st ed. scoring will break with the new expansion. Oops.

I prefer 3rd anyway, consider this:

You have secured a large central field such that it is impossible for anyone to steal that field away from you (assume that tower, princess/dragon are not in play). Now there are several open city "caps" in this field with no meeple. Under 1st ed scoring, if these were to be completed, you will earn 4 points for each of these cities at endgame and the person who completed the city would earn 2 points. Clearly, no one except you wants to do that. Basically, it's free points if you draw the tile and you have no rush to use a tile for that because no one else will. In 3rd ed scoring, you would earn 3 points at endgame if they were completed and the person completing the city would get 4. Now they have incentive to do so since they gain one point on you. It's also MUCH less confusing to look at each field, look at all the cities in it, and then remove the meeples before moving on to the next field.

Respuesta 3:
This does sound interesting, as the field scoring was the "Carc isn't my cup of tea"-part for me.

The rules in my box (just for comparison) state players score 4 points per _completed_ city that adjoin a field in which they have majority. I.e. you don't count points per fields or the farmers in the fields, but per each completed city. It's 4 points per city that your farmers "supply". It says explicitly regardless of city size.

If there are more (otherwise unconnected fields) supplying one single city, the player "owning" the majority of the supplying fields get the 4 points, if there is a tie, all players who tie get 4 points.

Which means, you look at each city, and see which player "owns" most fields connected to that city. That player earns 4 points. Even if you have 2 farmers in each field surrounding the city in question, you still just get 4 points.

In this scenario:
FIELD 1 -- CITY -- FIELD 2

Green has 2 farmers in field 1, and 2 in field 2
Red has 3 in field 1
Blue has 3 in field 2
I believe green earns nothing, and red and blue both get 4 points, despite the fact that green actually has more farmers (totally) supplying the city. Which is about precisely what I hate with that final scoring.

I also prefer the 3rd edition farm scoring rules. It's just easier to do, and it's more intuitive. The first couple of times I played, I accidentally scored it that way, in any case, because it's the same way that everything else in the game gets scored.
Cities, roads and cloisters all get scored based upon completion (for those that get completed), and during scoring, you only need to focus upon that one city, for example, not how many other cities lie within x radius of tiles from the city.

Even in 3E scoring, Red and Blue each earn 6, because they control the fields and the city can score for each field adjacent to it.

A key difference from 1E/3E would be:

(as above)
Green has 2 farmers in field 1, and 1 in field 2
Red has 3 in field 1, and 1 in field 2
Blue has 1 in field 2

In 1E scoring (edited after reading below posts), you check all the fields and find that Red has more farmers (4 total). The city has been scored and we move on to look at another city.

In 3E scoring, we check Field 1 and award red 3 points for the city. For any other city touching this field we award 3 more points. We then forget about that and go to Field 2, awarding 3 points to all 3 players for the same city, and again, any other cities touching this field, no matter how many times before (0 - infinity) they have been scored.

I tried staying with "1st edition" which is what Rio Grande kept since that is what won the awards. But the designer and original publisher migrated to 3rd edition and that is what I did as well. It wasn't that 1st edition was hard to keep track of, it was just that all subsquent expansions are designed with 3rd edition in mind. And while it was still possible to back-pedal the current expansions into 1st edition rules, we are seeing what seems to be an actual split now with the intorduction of Abbey and mayors.

Jay did the community a great disservice by not reconciling with Germany when the big box rules came out. it was the perfect opportunity to do so and bring great unity and peace to the world.

So play what you want as Sag mentions. However, I think it only really works best if play plain vanilla Carc. If you start adding in the expansions then, you really need to just adopt 3rd edition. And to me, 3rd edition goes more in line with the logic of the other scoring methods and is much easier to track what has and hasn't been scored at the edn of the game. Points-wise, I don't think one has an advantage over the other.

Respuesta 8:
We score by looking at each city. Whoever has the most farmers tracing to the city get three points, four if their pig(s) also can. Each city pays once.

Didn't 2nd edition also have some sort of goofy "any one player cannot get points from the same city more than once?" rider? I thought that was the main reason for the rapid replacement of 2nd ed rules - they tried to simplify the city-tracking of 1st ed by turning it into field-tracking, but then put in a clause that'd force players to do painful amounts of city-tracking anyway.

Re-check, I misunderstood the rules then... my example:
FIELD 1 -- CITY -- FIELD 2
Green 2 farmers in both fields,
Red 3 farmers in Field 1
Blue 4 farmers in field 2

would thus mean 4 points to green only, according to my rules.

But, the rules in my book are no version of the above stated, as they seem to be the 1st edition, but they explicitly stat that all cities are worth 4 points, no matter the size. The "2-tile cities are only worth 2" is only adapted for when you build the city /normally cities are worth 2 points per tile).

In 1E all cities are worth 4 points when doing farm scoring. Period. That's what your rules mean.
In 3E, each city is worth 3 points during farm scoring, but may be scored once per field that it touches (only would not be score once for each field if a field is empty).
In both editions, size of the city doesn't matter (but it must be complete).

In 1E, a 2-tile complete city scores 2 points for a meeple placed in the city. In 3E that same city is worth 4 for a meeple in the city. (Not sure offhand what effect shields in the city have in 1E, if it's even possible. In 3E they would clearly be worth 2 points each.)

That reverses the true difference in complexity between 1st and 3rd edition scoring. In practice, condisering the steps you actually have to go though, it's more like this:

First Edition: For each city, count the total number of farmers adjacent to the city in all adjacent fields. The player with the most such farmers farmers supplying the city earns the 4 points. (Too keep track of scoring, players may wish to consider placing a token in each scored city.)

Third Edition: The owner(s) of each field score 3 points per completed city bordering it. (As with all other features, you can remove followers as each field is score

Note that if you use 1st Edition scoring, It is unclear how expansions should influence scoring. Also note that the logistics of scoring in the 3rd Edition parallel those for any other feature: players with the most followers in the feature get points, and all followers in the feature are returned to their owners.

Respuesta 16:
This is interesting to read. Our group was also playing with the third edition method of figuring out who should get points, but giving them the first edition score (four per city). That method seemed intuitive and kind of went by the rules, although reading it more closely I see it says all farms surrounding the city need to be accounted for. I think I'll just print out the third edition rules and use them from now on - it's a lot easier and probably a lot more fair.

Respuesta 17:
Just got it, I think I must have 1st edition rules since it says 4 pts for the towns. Very interesting, but I like the game

I have started scoring farms exclusively with the third edition rules, since that's the version that the Xbox Live version uses. Of course, that's mostly because I got my wife to start playing the board game with me after she got hooked on the online game.

These statements are incorrect. The 2 pts for "small" cities is when the city itself is scored (upon completion) - the size of the city has never affected farm scoring.

From 1st edition rules:

•For each city a farm supplies, the player who deployed the farmer earns 4 points, regardless of the size of the city.

Note that 3rd edition rules removed the penalty for scoring a "small" city and it is worth 4 pts to the player that completes it.

Carl Bussema
@InfoCynic
I prefer 3rd anyway, consider this:

You have secured a large central field such that it is impossible for anyone to steal that field away from you (assume that tower, princess/dragon are not in play). Now there are several open city "caps" in this field with no meeple. Under 1st ed scoring, if these were to be completed, you will earn 4 points for each of these cities at endgame and the person who completed the city would earn 2 points. Clearly, no one except you wants to do that. Basically, it's free points if you draw the tile and you have no rush to use a tile for that because no one else will.
This is a false assumption. Under 1st ed rules, an opponent could complete the city and use their meeple to farm the tile, potentially preventing you from farmer-scoring that city. In 1st ed. rules, completed farms are not guaranteed to score points.
Also, the end-of game scoring mechanism dovetails nicely with the King & Scout set - Place an unused meeple on each complete city and count them to give the King's score. Then remove each meeple as you allocate the 4-farmer-points for each city.

Respuesta 22:
I don't think those 2-tile Cities = 2 points references were incorrect. The poster was explaining the differences between scoring in the various editions--not just scoring Farmers. One thing that is erroneous, however, is that Fields can be completed. Even a Field that is entirely surrounded and without gaps isn't complete and the Farmers will remain Farmers their whole lives with no room for promotion.

For those of you that prefer 3rd edition scoring because it means that Fields are handled more like all other projects, I wonder if you count diagonal tiles when completing Cloisters. No other projects consider diagonal tiles, thus you should not do so for Cloisters.

Furthermore, the score of a Field should be based on the Field tiles, not the City tiles. This is counter-intuitive and not like any of the other scoring procedures in all of Carcassonne. I sure hope they fix this glaring mistake in the inevitable 4th edition so that no-one plays the same game anymore.

Oh, and you can't hijack a Cloister by wedging another Monk into it. Totally unacceptable! This flies in the face of all other scoring conventions regardless of edition.

And for those that play by 3rd edition rules because they are simpler, I wonder why you'd even bother visiting a site with "geek" in the title and yet here you are posting. Are we not geeks? Are we incapable of thinking or keeping track of who has more Followers connected to a completed City by a continuous plain of green? 3rd edition rules solved nothing. The change alone causes more confusion than having someone read a very well-written and well-illustrated rule sheet. Or perhaps geeks can't read.

If there was any flaw in the scoring of the classic rules, it is that it didn't mention flagging the Cities as they are scored at the game's end for those players that couldn't figure it out on their own. Happily, Hunters & Gatherers had the foresight to include little green wafers for flagging tiger-ravaged antelopes. Because this is completely superfluous, I recommend putting these wafers in your Carcassonne game to flag the farmed Cities.



Tema 440: My dream of a concise turn order summary
Pregunta:
Hello. Welcome to my first post!
I have recently uploaded a file that I hope will generate a little discussion. While playing Carcassonne with all the expansions, I got into a debate about which events took place in which order. The rules are not always clear on this. Also, there were some new players who needed to be reminded about what they may or must do on a turn.
So please have a look at my "fool-proof" Carcassonne turn order summary and feel free to post any comments you have. I am always looking to make it better. My plan, though, is to keep it limited to one page.
Have fun!

Tema 441: Best method to score farms?
Pregunta:
With all the discussion about the different versions to score farms, I am still leaning towards the Rio Grande rules as we tried the third edition last night and did not like it.
What is the most official method to use? What method would you use if you were running a tournament?

Cheers.

@kanoe
What is the most official method to use? What method would you use if you were running a tournament?
The "most" official method must the one used by most publishers, which I guess would be Hans im Glück's 3rd ed. rules:

The player(s) with most Farmers on a Field score 3 points for each completed city adjacent to that Field (4 point if he has a pig on that field).

If I was running a turnament I would use the same rules.
They are ones used in the official World Championships.

Respuesta 2:
I agree that the Annotated Rules should be used (but then I'm the translator).

Seriously, here's my take, for what it's worth:

Basics:

RGG 1st edition rules come in the box. That makes them official.

HiG 3rd edition rules come in the box. That makes them official.

Complications:

But HiG is the original producer of the game, so that makes their rules 'more' official.

However, the 1st edition rules are the ones which won the Game of the Year, so that makes them 'more' official.

Further Complications:

And then along comes the Big Box. Both RGG and HiG publish new rules 'in the box', so to speak. HiG follows their tradition of continually updating the rules to take account of new expansions, unforeseen implications, and fan questions. RGG implement some of those updates, and ignore others, for the first time diluting the 'purity' of their rules. Although the RGG Big Box basically sticks to the 1st edition rules, some of the game elements which relate to farm scoring are changed, such as the status of pigs. So whereas pervious RGG editions of the game and all expansions used the '1st' edition rules (excepting errors of translation), the RGG Big Box uses a mixture of old and new. It's simply less cohesive than the HiG version.

Tournament:

AFAIK, if you're in Germany, tournaments will follow the HiG Big Box rules.

If you're in America, well, who knows? That will depend on the organisers. But whether RGG or HiG is chosen, both should follow the Big Box rules, since they are the currently endorsed rules of both producers.

[warning]Comment/Advice

I actually think that serious players should use the HiG Big Box rules. They're easy enough to find here on BGG or at CarcassonneCentral (shameless plug). There's nothing elitist about that - if right now you were in Germany, where the game comes from, and picked up the game at a store that's what you'd be playing. I really don't see why there's much of an argument about this.

The 'it comes in the box' argument for RGG is fine, but that's just an argument for what you're used to - simple preference, nothing more.

And personally I think that the 'Game of the Year' argument is vacuous - it's like saying, for example, that because Microsoft Windows 95 won a design award, no-one should update to Vista. There's the elitism - the version we use is more 'authentic'.

And anyway, the whole RGG/HiG thing is so America-orientated. If I was playing, say, the Dutch version, or the Swedish version, or the Czech version, the debate would be between their local publisher and the HiG rules. What the HiG rules have going for them is that they will automatically be the rules by which all other versions are judged, because they are the original.

So my advice is: take the plunge. Get used to the HiG rules.[/warning]

1st edition - each city gives four points to the player with the most farmers around it (each city scores once)

3rd edition - the owner of each farm gets three points for each city the farm touches (each city scores multiple times, sometimes multiple times per player)

This is not true.
The game sold very well in the first edition (HiG) but "someone" whispered in their ears
that the Farmer rule made the game too complicated to win the award.
So it was changed for the 2nd. edition (which won the award).

However this was a rush job (in order to have the game ready in all shops with the SdJ-logo) and it wasn't much better than the first edition, so the final change was made for the 3rd edition.

One other way is to totally misunderstand the rules (even before 3rd edition and Big Box) and accidentally use rules that dont exist, not realize you are playing the wrong rules, and then come to find out you were playing the 3rd edition rules with 1st edition scoring.

So what rules are being used on the BSW online version of Carc?

I've been assuming it was 4 points per city awarded to the player with the most farmers supplying that city?

Whilst this rule set makes scoring the 'real' game a bit of a chore, it does seem a bit more 'cut-throat' than the "let's all share nicely, here have 3 points per farmer" system...

Respuesta 9:
We play Carcassonne a lot, sooo much that it has become an obsession.

We prefer the 1st edition method of scoring Farmer Meeples BECAUSE -- it is the one that we are accustomed to; and trying to convert (convince)everyone in our group to change over to the 3rd edition at this time would be a nightmare, since I am the only one who reads BBG and is looked to as the resident expert.

YES it is more cut-throat, BUT that's half the fun and I see that it has a balancing effect in the overall game because some players like myself prefer the Now-Points strategy of sneaking into other player's Town & Road features to consistently rack up a few points often; while other players like my wife, son, and step-daughter, have a good eye for tracing how the green areas interconnect and utilize a Later-Points style of many Farmers to bring in a bunch of points at one time, but not until the end game phase.

A recent problem that we have run into is scoring Farmers with multiple Pigs. Besides the Meeple Pig that came with the Traders and Builders Exp. and the Pig Herd tile that is included with the River-II Exp, now I also have a Pig Herd tile with four green sides that came with the Gamer's Quarterly Magazine #11 insert -- everyone here says it looks like a pig herd, so we should treat it like a pig herd, in spite of what the official HiG & RGG rulings dictate. Therefore when playing with ALL the expansions, the player with the MOST Farmers in a field can potentially receive 4 points +1 (for 1st Pig), +1 (for 2nd Pig), +1 (for 3rd Pig) ...OR... Seven (7) Points for each completed town - each town being scored only once. This can turn a casual friendly game into a Machiavelian battle of wits as Dragon movements and Tower placements become a crucial during every turn and a decisive second or third Farmer can bring a player from last place to first.

However -- my advice for running a tournament is to open a brand new box of Carcassonne and read the rules aloud to everyone who must then consent to their understanding of such in order to avoid any contentious arguments between players at the end -- use the K.I.S.S. Principle (Keep It Simple Stupid!) and gear the play toward the lowest common demoninator. The most important thing about a competitive tournament is to BE CONSISTENT .....&obtw: to have FUN doing it.

Just to complicate matters, BSW have implemented both sets of scoring. The default is the 3-points-per-farm method, but you can choose to select the (old) 4-points-per-city method.
When I play online I use the default (new) method. When I play F2F, we use the old method. This isn't as complicated as it sounds. What we do at game end is score all the up-standing meeples, leaving just the lying-down-farmer meeples. Then we put 1 up-standing meeple in each complete city. Next we count these meeples (for the King bonus), then remove them one at a time, scoring the farmer points as we go. This makes scoring easier, but also allows you to play the more interesting (in our view) farmer rules.

It's not specifically answering your question, but I know that the Xbox Live Arcade version gives you the option to choose which rules you want to use in regards to farms--either what they term "US" rules (4 points for each bordering city to one player) or "International" rules (the 3-points-to-everyone, friendlier game). It's certainly nice to be able to tailor it to your preference, and people should feel free to do so with the real boardgame, too.

What is the source for this claim?

I bought the game after it won the award, but before the logo was printed on it. My copy is from the second print run, and contains the first edition rules.

SDJ was awarded on june 25 2001. It wasn't until early august that there was a sudden outcry in the german gaming community. How can it be that a publisher changes the rules for a game that won the award? Shouldn't the award then be retrieved?

Then a representative of the publisher declared here (german) that Hans im Glück contacted the jury and asked whether they could change the rules. The jury gave their ok, subject to the condiditon that the publisher tests the change beforehand and approves it. And so it was done.

I'm actually quite glad this thread has shifted its focus slightly, because this is interesting. Also, the fact that the 2nd edition caused a brief scandal on Spielbox does give a little fuel to the claim that the RGG version is 'more true' to the original. (Still less than convinced, though).

So thanks for that. Worth bookmarking for future reference.

Respuesta 17:
We switched to the newer version as soon as we found out about it. There is something simpler about it (to the way we process the information) with being able to point at a farmer, count the cities it supplies, multiply by 3 (or 4 if pig too), and then pick up the farmer and forget about it.

The original method meant we kept all farmers on the board until all cities had been scored "just in case". We would sometimes confuse exactly which cities had already been scored if there ended up being too many clusters of little cities, or miss a farmer that was far away in an extended field and have to go back and recalculate again.

The other nice thing about it is that we normally play 2 players at our house. That way, if you and your opponent end up having farmers in the same field you can just pick them up and call it a wash. It probably would work for the original scoring method too, but I never sat down to see if that would really be the case and was afraid that some obscure scenario would arise where an advantage in one or more city would then be lost.

Purely speculation on my part after talks with the publisher, jury members and others within the industry at the time. The game sold very well and was reprinted at least once before it was nominated, but the rules weren't changed until after it had won the award.

Print runs are not the same as editions.
The second (and third?) print run was still the first edition. The game sold 30,000 copies or more before the game won the award.

Wait... what? No... you STILL leave the farmers down until the end of the game, no matter WHAT version you are using. Unless you've misread something, or are playing an unofficial variant. The ONLY thing that changed is that you score less per city, and the scoring is done from the "farmer's" perspective, rather than the city's. If I'm understanding what you say, that is.

Yes, I've found this to be the best technique for scoring farmers with a slight adjustment -- I do NOT like putting standing meeples back onto the game board after they've been Final Scored for their respective feature and removed; we prefer to use coins, buttons, poker-chips ...OR... (the best we've tried so far) the Carcassonne Tower pieces, so as not to confuse them with the lying-down farmers waiting to be scored. Oh, and we ALSO score the farmer points first placing an item on each city, one at a time, and THEN the bonus points for the King because there is a marker on each completed city by this time making it quite simple -- the very last thing to be scored is the Robber Baron, which we do by shifting the markers on cities onto completed roads.

I took a good hard look at the new rules and talked it over with a few of my friends, BUT decided to stick to what we were already quite comfortable with, which apparently is the 1st ed. rules (see my comments above). Yes...it is sometimes confusing to trace the interconnected green fields and NOT miss any cluster of little cities that may be worth enough points (4x each) to somebody, but it is worth the effort.

Unfortunately everyone in my gaming group wants me to keep score and with age related CRS, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to constantly switch FROM left-brained color pattern recognition and spacial relations TO right-brained mathematical calculations and logical deductions.

Personnally I'm getting a little tired of playing over and over with the friends who insist on "Playing nice with others" instead of "Running headlong with scissors!" They consistently REFUSE to eat anyone's meeples when it's their turn to move the Dragon and only rarely take a Prisoner with a strategic Tower placement.

I realize that there is a whole Meta-Game thing going on between spouses and significant-others who don't want to "sleep on the couch" or be in the doghouse for offending their beloved, but come on it's ONLY a game, right? If you want to "help" each other build something constructive -- play Bob The Builder, Lego Creator or just work together on a puzzle non-competitively and non-threateningly.

That's what I love about Carcassonne -- it has SO MANY facets and styles of play to suit your mood, that it can easily become a GREAT GAME instead of just a [time] filler. I guess once you've achieved a certain skill level of mastery, this game (and probably most games) NEEDS to be played by total strangers at a convention or in a tournament setting so that real cut-throat-ness can be manifested to appease those deep-seated psychic (or psychotic) desires. But then again that's not true gamesmanship is it? L.O.L.

Tema 442: More rules questions !
Pregunta:
Hi all,

Haven't posted here in a while, partly becos I haven't played Carcassonne with anyone over the past few months. I've recently bought The River II, The Count and The Tower expansions. I've played a couple of games with friends and we noted a few questions regarding the new additional rules. I'll get straight to the point, if I may...

1. Towers. Can the towers be used to remove meeples (or other pieces) from within the City of Carcassonne (but not The Count himself, obviously) ?

2. Count & Towers. When playing with both the Count and the Tower expansions, a player completes an opponent's feature (road, city, cloister) with a tower foundation tile. Can he then deploy a follower to the City of Carcassonne, as per the rules for the Count AND, at the same time, begin or add to a tower on the tile laid or a previous one ? This does appear to be against the placement rules for followers (2 pieces in one turn) but it seems to be unfair if this is not the case otherwise.

3. Towers - Order of play for ransoming. When should a player's wish to pay a ransom be declared... before or after a tile is drawn ? Can a follower who is retrieved via a ransom payment then be used IMMEDIATELY either on the tile placed, or perhaps even somewhere else via a magic portal ? Or perhaps the follower may not be used until the following turn.. ?

Maybe ransom payments are considered part of scoring and therefore should only occur at the end of a player's turn, which I expect means that players MUST NOT use the follower until their next turn.

4. Towers & Princesses. We noticed there are tiles where there is a tower foundation within the walls of towns. When a player has a meeple atop a tower within a town, can an opponent use the Princess to evict that meeple from the tower, or is it ONLY knights holding the town that may be evicted ?

5. Towers. Do meeples on towers within town walls count towards scoring completed towns that are in contention by multiple players ? And if so, would that meeple be removed upon scoring as per normal pieces ?

Perhaps that would mean that the meeple atop the tower IS considered to be a knight in this case, and therefore he could be evicted with the Princess.

Your opinions are welcomed

Regards,
TassieDevil

Respuesta 1:
1. No.
2. Yes. He may first do the tower stuff (if he makes no other deployment and does not move the fairy) and then, at the end of the turn (if only other players scored as the result of his tile placement) he may place a follower in the City.
3. Immediately after a tower piece is placed. Taking and exchanging prisoners are part of the same action, which preclude any other deployment actions, so there's no way to use and exchanged follower on the same turn you get it back through and exchange.
4. Towers are not part of any feature.

I've recently printed v3.5.2 of the AnnotatedRules.pdf (yes yes, I know.. we only just found that later versions are available ) but noticed in my newly acquired v3.7.1 that it doesn't state anywhere that the ransoming of meeples MUST occur ONLY on the turn where a foundation tile is actually drawn and played. The language is a little ambiguous there... ie, it can be read that ransoming may occur on ANY turn (so long as the player has enough points to pay for it). I certainly think that's fairer considering how difficult it may be for players to retrieve their meeples back otherwise ! When U think about it, the more players in the game there are, the less chance you'll have of selecting a foundation tile, and thus the significantly decreased chance of recovering your followers ! Ouch !

I noticed tho that the new rules compendium clearly states that the follower may be used immediately upon return, however...

Respuesta 5:
You misinterpret Roys's comments. he is NOT saying the only time you can exchange meeples is when you draw a Foundtion tile. he was answering a specific question of yours regarding capturing and exchanging as it involved towers.

the point is, exchanged meeples are useless to you until the next turn if you just captured another meeple to broker an exchange. If you try to capture someone else's meeple on this turn to get your meeple back, that is fine. But in order to capture someone, you would have placed the tower, in order to place the tower, you already passed up your ability to place a meeple this turn.

EDIT: And yes, i think the new big box rules threw are established timing off. Sufficiently so that I no longer know for sure!

he was answering a specific question of yours regarding capturing and exchanging as it involved towers.
Actually, I didn't mention anything about prisoner exchange, U guys did... I don't think there's any ambiguity in the compendium with regards to prisoner exchanges... it's all quite logical, really. My question was purely about the timing of paying the ransom during a player's turn, and when that ransomed follower can actually be used, which I believe has nothing to do with the drawing or placement of tower foundation tiles..

That's right. Carcassonne City tiles are off limits to all figures except those placed inside City quarters as a result of the City rules.

3. Immediately after a tower piece is placed. Taking and exchanging prisoners are part of the same action, which preclude any other deployment actions, so there's no way to use and exchanged follower on the same turn you get it back through and exchange.
It doesn't state anywhere that the ransoming of meeples MUST occur ONLY on the turn where a foundation tile is actually drawn and played. The language is a little ambiguous there...
To clarify: The exchange of prisoners occurs immediately, as part of the tower piece placement action. Ransoming for points occurs at the start of the turn (before the turn actually), before any steps repeated as a result of the builder or volcano.

I'm not so sure we should assume these things. If the dragon is not allowed to have any effect on followers placed within the City walls, I don't see that as being reason enough that the Towers should not as well ! Other than the net effect of their actions being the same, that is to say that the Towers can force the removal of pieces from the board just as the dragon does, they're completely unrelated game mechanisms. One might argue that there is evidence to suggest the opposite, actually. Is it not true that the Towers have the additional function of preventing other pieces within their range from being removed from the board (at the cost of losing the use of a follower for the duration of the game unless there's intervention by the dragon), whereas the dragon has no such dual capability ? This task of protection is entrusted to a different mechanism, the fairy, complete with it's additional benefits (it's proximity generating extra points at game's end, when a feature is completed, and at the start of a "possessing" player's turn).

I guess I'm saying that the Towers have a range of effect, reaching beyond the tile on which it stands (including possibly over "gaps" where no tiles exist!), and the dragon does not (it certainly cannot go where a tile has not yet been placed). No other piece in the game has a similar "ranged" capability.

Having said that, historically, of course, I think towers of this nature were purely fixed defensive structures...

And ya know... after just spending about 45 minutes writing this absolutely brilliant argument above (or so I thought ), I've just this minute re-read the rules in The Count expansion and found that it clearly states (with a little tongue-in-cheek embellishment from myself)...

"Followers not moved (to take advantage of a completed feature), remain in (behind the nice, cosy walls of the City of) Carcassonne. The followers in (that's inside the unquestionable fortification of the City of) Carcassonne may only be moved as described above. They may not be moved in or removed from (the womb-like protection offered by the walls of the City of) Carcassonne in any other way (eg. returned to the player's play areas) !"

I just didn't have the heart to delete it... what a waste that would have been... ROFL ! But what the heck... I mean geez.. they claimed that Fort Eben-Emael was impenetrable, too !

They really should cut all those (pointing) bloody trees down, ya know. They're blocking my view of the forest...

The followers in Carcassone City don't stay there because of the dragon. they stay there because they have only one way in and one way out: the rules that govern them are the rules from the count of Carcassonne. They are immune from the effects going on in the countryside.

In addition, both the dragon and the towers are goverened by tiles orthogonally in their way. (A tower can reach 5 tiles away and more but can't touch the tile immediately diagonala to its base? ridiculous!) Anyway, you must be on a tile in order to be affected by the dragon or the tower. Followers in Carc City are not on a tile - they are in a generic "quarter" of the city. So since their specific location is not defined, they cannot fall under the ruls of the dragon or the tower.

Everything I've said is either from the rules (HiG, 3rd edition, German), from the FAQ, or from Matt Harper's direct correspondence with HiG.

But I wouldn't sweat any of it. The game is pretty loosely balanced after all, and any way your group is comfortable playing is fine. The answers I gave are just the strictest interpretation of the publisher's "official" views, but there's no reason to think of those as sacred. Many of the answers HiG gave to Matt showed that they clearly did not quite understand the questions he was asking, or had not ever thought through some of the implications he had raised (esp. for interactions among expansions). And RGG's "Big Box" rules mostly just confuse things, and I would ignore them.



Tema 443: rrrr tile scoring for farms
Pregunta:
I'm looking at one of the rrrr tiles from the basic set. It has a road coming in from each edge that terminates at a settlement. If you inspect this tile, it looks as though there are not four separate farm segments, but rather, that they all connect in the middle. So, for scoring farms, how does this tile count? Like four separate farm sections? Or does this tile indeed join the four farms together?

I'm sorry if this question has been answered. I checked the annotated rules and the message board. I apologize if I've missed it.

Respuesta 1:
It separates the farms. You can only connect farms through a series of connected green edges, not through the center of tiles.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for the quick response. That's how we've been playing. But someone did raise the issue and it seemed like a reasonable argument when looking at the tile.



Tema 444: Confused about farms
Pregunta:
We've played this game a couple of years, and just recently bought the expansions included in the Big Box. Therefore I printed the rules for Big Box that was found on this site. However, now a question arises:

The way I see it on the origial rules on page 4 a city can only generate points once, you determine how many farmers supports the city and the player/s that have majority earns 4 points/city.

But in the Big Box rules that I just browsed (page 9) it says that if you have two different fields where blue have sole majority on field one he gets 4 points for every city bordering that farm. And if another field also borders those cities (and in the example he shares majority with red) he gets another 4 points/city (and red also gets 4 points/city for this field)?? The sum might be the same but I'd say that red gets nothing and blue 4 points/city...

The rules I read are translated by Matthew Harper, found for download below.

Thanks for any input.

There are also 2nd edition rules with slightly different farm scoring.

Note that there is another important difference: In 1st edition rules, completed 2 tile cities only score 2 points. In 3rd edition, they score 4 points.

Respuesta 2:
I think the newer edition of the rules make it easier to score the farms. I too first played with the old rules where you looked from one city to the next determining what farms supplied it. I think the new rules where you simply look at a farm, determien who has the control(most followers) then just count up the number of farms and score accordingly.

Just my thoughts.

I'd avoid the Big Box rules. They're sprawling and confusing. There are better comprehensive rules references here and online (posted by people who are active here), notably those by Matt Harper.

The 3rd Edition rules are a lot simpler than that*:

Quote:
The owner(s) of each field score 3 points per completed city bordering it.
That's it. In the 3rd edition, the mechanics of scoring parallel those for any other feature: players with the most followers in the feature get points, and all followers in the feature are returned to their owners.

Hi,
I've been playing Carcassonne for a couple of years now. Not too sure about what edition it is (not too bothered). I have all the expansions and use all when I play so loads of cities/farms to score at the end.

The scoring for farms I use is each completed city is worth 4 points. The player with the most meeples surronding that city gets the 4 points regardless of what field they are in. If players tie with the same number of meeples then both players get 4 points then onto the next city.

To keep track of which cities have been scored we put a marker on the city once it has been scored as there can be quite a few in a large game.

Hope this helps
Neil

Respuesta 8:
It's very easy to be confused as there have been three different rules for scoring farms:

German 1st ed and Rio Grande rule: Look at each completed city, the player(s) with the most meeples summed over all the connected farms scores 4 points.

German 2nd ed rule: Look at each completed city, if a player has the most meeples in at least one connected farm, he score 3 points.

German 3rd ed rule: Look at each farm, the player(s) with teh most meeples in that farm scores 3 points for each connected completed city.

Note in both the 2nd and 3rd ed rules you can eliminate all but one meeples of the player with the most in each farm before score to make it easier.

There is also one other rule change between editions:
in 1st & 2nd es and Rio Grande rules: two tile cities only score 2 point on completion, while in 3rd ed two tile cities score 4 points.

Basically Rio Grande decided to not change the their rulebook when the German editions changed. So you should always discuss this when playing with new players to avoid scoring arguments.



Tema 445: Scoring
Pregunta:
I am new to carcassonne and there is a rule I still don't understand. Can scoring be made for completed road, city or cloister but there is no follower on it?

No. The only way to score any feature is by having a majority in the number (greater than none) of followers on the feature.

Respuesta 2:
Roy is correct.

As a side note, it is sometimes possible to place a tile that completes a feature, put a meeple on that feature on the tile, score the feature, and get your meeple back, all on the same turn. The meeple is only out there temporarily, and since he's not stuck on the board for long, it's almost like scoring without having him out there at all.

A clarification so as not to confuse any literalists - one does not need a *majority* to score. They just need to have a number of followers such that no other player has more followers on the feature.

If Red, Green, and Blue have 2, 2, and 1 figure (respectively) on a feature, none of them have a majority (of 5 figures, 3 is majority). But Red and Green each score it.

One more detail ...

You must have the follower available in your supply when you place the tile in order to play it on the feature. You can't score a feature and use the follower(s) you get back to place on another feature in the same turn.

That follows from the sequence of play:
(1) Place tile.
(2) Place follower (optionally).
(3) Score completed features.

So there are no "follower(s) you get back" (in 3) when you're placing them (in 2) — except, of course, those from previous turns.

You're correct -- there's only one reason to score tied features, and that is if you want to compare scores across games. In that case, you just have to be consistent (always score ties, or never score them).

And yeah, points for empty features is a pretty literalist reading of the rules.

There's also some people who like to evaluate final score differences both by subtraction (you beat me by 20 points!) and by division (you doubled my score!). Some people keep track of games in which they were 'skunked' (finished with a score less than 75% of the winning score) or double-skunked (finished with a score less than 50% of the winning score). In those circumstances, choosing not to count mutual scoring can affect those numbers.

Of course, it'll never affect who won. But it affects "How badly one was beaten" if one likes to evaluate that as a percentage or a ratio.

Tema 447: Opinion on correct sequence of play
Pregunta:
I pulled my rules back out and took a look at what RGG originally said in both of these cases. All I have is an english translation of the HiG Cathar rules as it was never touched by RGG.

In both The Count and the Cathars, the issues at hand are resolved at the end of the turn. The placing of a meeple into Carc city and the Knight escaping through a cloister both happen at the same time - so there is no evidence, unless Ron has something I overlooked, that says one must happen before the other. Since they both happen "at the end of the turn" I think it would then be up to the current player's discretion in which order he played this. So it seems that fter all the discussion, HiG was right: A knight could escape through the cloister and go into Carc city at the end of the turn.

Respuesta 1:
I think the distinction that needs to be made is that there is still a "beginning," a "middle," and an "end" of turn. When you use the builders ability, you still have only one "beginning" and one "end." What you get a duplicate of is the "middle."

And the middle consists of drawing a tile, placing it, scoring points, getting your meeple back. (And I am sure I missed a few other steps in there.)

So for example in the beginning, you can only score once if he fairy is in your tile/feature. At the end, you can only pull out one meeple from a besieged city.

Now the Count says that if you score a feature for someone else but not yourself, then at the end of your turn, you get to place a meeple in Carc City. So while this action is activated during the "middle" part of the turn, it isn't actually executed until the "end" of the turn.

So by using the builder function, you have 2 "middles" and if in each of those middles you score someone else's feature with out scoring points for yourself, you just activated 2 potential meeples going to Carc City. This is consistent with the rules that clearly spell out the builder can send 2 meeple to Carc city.

But these actions do not occur until the end of the turn. So while you now get two of the same "end" actions, they are there because the two "middle" actions actually triggered them. The other end actions, activated only by the end of the turn - such as allowing a knight to escape - are only allowed once because the trigger only happens once.

To me, this is the only way that the rules work given what we have from HiG. In addition, it doesn't appear to conflict with any other ruling. Does it makes sense?

Respuesta 2:
dvader123
wrote:
Thanks. That makes sense. I guess as of now these two actions can occur in any order.

A. Place meeple(s) inside Carc City
B. Remove meeple(s) from besieged city
However, if you do B first, then the meeple could be relocated into Carcassonne, this is not possible if A is first. So, it is important what order you decide to to this in, especially if you are allowing two meeples into Carcassonne City, because you are even more likely to be running short of meeples.

The rules for The Count still say when your opponent score and you don't, you place your meeple at the end of you turn. Which is still different than right after scoring.

I think the problem with HiG answering, being a limited observer through Matt's hard work is that multiple people tend to answer. I am unsure they understand why we are asking or that they even consult previous statements before forming their own. It seems that this statement id in direct conflict from a previous statement. Should we just keep listening to the most current answer?

Respuesta 5:
Quote:

Really? I have always understood that the builder turn is a completely separate turn, and so you COULD deploy a second follower to Carcassonne.

Respuesta 6:
My take on this would still be that deploying to Carcassonne happens 'at the end of the turn' is the sense of 'after scoring', while escaping occurs 'at the end of the turn' in the sense of 'just before the next player's turn'. (Scoring a bonus point occurs 'at the start of the turn' in the sense of 'immediately after your turn begins / before you even draw your first tile'.)

I'd argue this because deploying to Carcassonne is linked to scoring, whereas escape and the fairy bonus are 'special' cases. However, the only way to check this is to write and ask directly in precisely the formulation we want. Something like:

'The rules for the Count state that only one follower per turn may be moved to Carcassonne. How many followers may I move to Carcassonne in a double turn?

And when can I move followers to Carcassonne in a double turn - immediately after scoring, or at the very end of the turn, after both tiles have been placed?'

As far as inconsistency is concerned, I always correspond with Georg Wild at HiG. But I think the problem is that the FAQ on the official site is still down, and they don't have a canon of FAQ at the moment. Whereas we are able to refer back to all the FAQ which were posted, and all the FAQ I've added from direct correspondence, and we view them as a single body of questions, HiG themselves have a smaller body of questions to refer to, and which are less public and to a certain extent out-of-date. There are bound to be issues sometimes… Though I wouldn't want to say that I/we/anyone (even RGG) know the rules better than HiG. Having designed the games, they know what the intention behind the rules was - all we can do is infer the intention, and then check if our inference is correct. Sometimes, of course, we'll end up pointing out something they themselves hadn't thought of (I wouldn't be surprised, for example, if our question about pigs and builders being placed on towers wasn't instrumental in the 'demotion' of pigs and builders to non-followers). It isn't really inconsistency, just a clash of different perspectives and types of information.

Which is a fine distinction. I would somewhat agree that you have scoring, "end of turn" meeple placement in Carcassonne, "end of turn" meeple escape, then the next player's turn. But I think when you introduce the builder, the "end of turn" meeple placement in Carcassonne is delayed until the "2nd turn" is completed.

It could impact your decision of meeple placement when you are running low. If you place a meeple and cause scoring while also causing the builder to be activated, it could impact placement. Do you put the meeple in Carc City because of the first scoring? or hold off until you see what tile you draw? If you must place a meeple in Carc city immediately after scoring, this option would then expire after your second turn.

That may be a good idea. The issue eally comes form integrating all the expansions. This comes aout because of Cathars, Traders & Builders, The Count, and Princess & Dragon all combined. It really is a unique circumstance but one that should be clarified none the less.

My apologies. I was under the impression from Great Dane that the FAQ was a collection of answers from multiple representatives of HiG.

I only bring this up because of dealings with Hasbro's FAQs fir their games. We typically had 1 customer service representative and sometimes he would just answer off the cuff without doing the research. Or, he would answer the question but not in light of why we were bringing it up. So while he knew the rules and the game better than we did, he still didn't have the benefit of knowing the discussions that lead up the question. And so sometimes his answer was unifnormed because he didn't have the context.

But still, he was just a customer service rep and not the designer so sometimes we forced him to take it back to the design team when we felt he was "wrong." Most times we ended up being "right" because the design team hadn't thought of something and did see the logic in our discussion and so overruled the customer sercice rep.

It seems to me that we have two FAQ answers: 1) escaped meeples can go to Carc City on the same turn and now the just released 2) escaped meeples can NOT go to Carc City on the same turn. So I am curious why the discrepancy - actual change in thought or forgot the previous ruling or didn't understand the context of the discussion.

Respuesta 9:
@ BrianMola: AFAIK, Georg Wild overseas the FAQ - I could be wrong, though. On one occasion an issue arose on my site because a different HiG rep had given different info to someone - I wrote to Georg and he told me that he remembered his colleague asking him what to say, and what happened was that the info was then passed on slightly inaccurately. So, the old FAQ from the official site are, well, official, and we can only hope they represent a consistent viewpoint. All of the direct FAQ (from me to HiG) are clearly marked as such, and are all in correspondence with one guy, who seems to be the person others in the company default to. I see what you mean about Hasbro, but I don't think that's quite the situation here. And although the direct FAQ have slightly lower status than the official ones (which are lower in status than they could be, since they're no longer on the official site) they aren't a compilation from various sources. Still, as you say, we need to keep challenging them if the rulings seem odd.

@ dvader123: The 'may' or 'must' rule is definite - I've had two confirmations of that already. Here's the full answer to one of the questions I asked last time (I didn't post it all because it's a bit generic):

Und im Allgemeinen: Werden die BigBox-Regeln von nun an die Standardregeln (4. Ausgabe) sein? Werden die HiG FAQ diese Änderung widerspiegeln?Inwiefern wird das auf weitere Erweiterungen einen Einfluss haben?
Ja, die Big-Box Regeln sollen für die nächsten Auflagen übernommen werden. Die beiden wichtigsten Änderungen sind:
Die Angleichung von Burgfräulein und Turm. In beiden Fällen hat der Spieler nun größere Freiheiten, also immer "kann" und immer "eigene oder fremde Figur". Das werden wir natürlich auch für zukünftige Erweiterungen beibehalten (sofern es ähnliche Funktionen nochmal gibt).
und die "Degradierung" von Baumeister und Schwein. Beide sind keine Gefolgsleute mehr um einige Folgefragen zu klären (Was passiert wenn ein Baumeister alleine zurück bleibt? Kann ein Baumeister gefangegenommen und gegen einen normalen Gefolgsmann ausgetauscht werden?)

Yes, the Big Box rules will be used in the next edition. The two most important changes are:
Harmonisation between princesses and towers. In both cases, the player now has more freedom, so it's always 'can' and 'the player's own figure or the figure of an opponent.' Naturally, we'll be keep that balance for future expansions (at least as far as there are similar functions.)
- and the 'demotion' of builders and pigs. Neither are followers anymore, in order to clarify certain implications (what happens when the builder is left alone? can the builder be taken prisoner and exchanged for a normal follower?)
As I said, not only is the change in the rules, but that's the second time that the distinction has been explained to me as one of the two most important changes, both of which share the aim of consistency and simplicity. The fact that HiG attach such significance to the change from 'must' to 'may' and yet RGG didn't incorporate the change is the oddest thing about it…

Respuesta 10:
Matt - thanks again for all of this. You're translating skills are much appreciated.

Looks like with some official clarifications and the practical discussions we've had, I'll be a 4th edition convert. Luckily, the expansions affected the most are the one I have played the least so my stubborness hasn't settled in...yet.

Just makes me wish even more that RGG righted the ship and adopted the 4th edition rules in their entirity.

So it seems that placing the dragon is one of the many "moving wood" options, and it wouldn't make sense to place the dragon and then move another piece like the builder, pig, or fairy, even if they aren't considered followers.
Actually, that is what you do when you move the dragon. With a normal dragon tile,you can deploy a meeple / place a tower block / move the fairy / etc., and then the game is interrupted for the dragon to move.

Moving the dragon isn't part of 'moving the wood' - that refers only to the player's 'wood' The dragon is a conditional based on tile placement, exactly the same as the princess or Cathars. The fact there's a wooden figure shouldn't distract you.

And then, if you think about it, it's logical that you can't deploy a follower when you place a volcano tile, but may when you place a dragon tile - because the rule for volcanos is that the dragon is moved / transported to the new tile immediately. Since that's the only tile on which you can deploy a follower, it would be eaten immediately.

But the fairy, on the other hand, has more freedom and can move to any tile on the board. The pig and builder, as we've seen, can be deployed to the tile, but are eaten immediately. But what we should ask HiG is whether we can place a tower block, or add a follower to a tower when we place a volcano tile…

I understand the movement of the dragon with the dragon tile, but placement of the builder, pig, or fairy on a volcano tile AFTER you had already placed the dragon is what confused me.

...

The rules are clear that only one wood piece can be moved per turn (except under the case of the builder). We shouldn't be allowed to move the dragon and then move something else, no?
No. The difference being is that he dragon plament (as well as the movement) is a mandatory occurance. You cannot choose to not move the dragon or place him on a volcano. So since this move/placement is dictated to you, it does not preclude you from freely choosing to place another piece elsewhere.

It seems to me the simplest solution was to let any piece be deployed to a volcano and then just point out how pointless that was because whatever is placed there is eaten instantaneously. Which in effect appears to be what is going on with the pigs and builders. There is no reason that I can think of why they would specifically allow pigs/buiulders to be placed on a volcano and eaten right away or to specifically exclude followers and not let them have the same fate as the pigs/builders. The only wood that should be moved after a dragon is placed, should be the fairy, period.

Maybe they have a future expansion rule and so are trying to distinguish this now instead of later. It just seems to be unnecessary confusion at this point.



Tema 448: 3rd edition farm scoring question
Pregunta:
I'm trying to grasp the farm scoring using 3rd edition, keep in mind i've been using RGG version for a few years now, so although I recognize that it's easier to check scoring using 3rd edition, I still have problem wrapping my head around a few things.
My question is this.
I understand from the examples that farms that are cut off by either empty space, roads, or other castles are scored separately from the other side of the castle.
However what i'm unsure of although I think I know the answeer is this. Let's say a castle is in the middle with no barriers cutting off the grass tiles around it, does it only have one farm (all sides) or does each side support a separate farm? I am thinking its all one farm, but just want to make sure.

Also as a side question in regards to tower expansion if someone can answer. If you put a meeple of yours on top of a tower to block it, and you later on capture your opponents meeple do you have to make prisoner exchange, do you have to give up the meeple you placed to block the tower?

Respuesta 1:
A city completely envoloped by a field is part of that field and the only field that that city touches. A field is bordered by the edges of hte tiles, roads, and any castle walls that connect roads to the edges of the tiles.

A meeple sitting on top of a tower is not a captured meeple (think of him like a watchman). So he cannot be exchanged for a prisoner since he is not one himself.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks,
So basically instead of counting farmers at each city, you are looking at each field section, judging who has the most meeples, and then scoring each completed city touching that field section. A field section is defined as you said borderwise.

As to the tower part, that makes sense to me. Basically everyone just has to remember that you meeple is a block meeple not a prisoner.

Thanks again.

Respuesta 3:
When you capture a prisoner, you set it in front of you - as if it were your supply. if everyone knows I am blue and I have a red meeple in front of me, then they know I have a prisoner. As soon as red captures a blue meeple, he must trade with me so that we each get our meeples back.

The meeples on the towers are not prisoners. All they do is prevent the further rise of that specific tower.

Tema 449: Scoring multiple catherdrals in a single city
Pregunta:
If you have both cathedrals in one city, only one of them counts. So you were right about it being 3 points for each tile and pennant. Same deal with inns on roads.

As far as beseiged city walls go, I don't know the rules for Die Katharer offhand, but I'm pretty sure every tile and pennant is worth 1 point upon the completion of the city.

Correct!
Not quite correct. A normal city scores 2 points per tile and 2 points per pennant.(using 3rd edition rules; but 1st edition only effects the 2-tile city).

The Inn effects this with a +1 modifier if completed and a flat out 0 if incomplete.

Likewise, the Cathars give this a -1 modifier if complete and a flat out 0 if incomplete.

So a beseiged completed city is worth 2 - 1 (for the cathars) = 1 per tile; 1 per pennant.

A besieged completed city with a cathedral is worth 2 + 1 (for the cathedral) - 1 (for the cathars) = 2 per city; 2 per pennant. The piety of the cathedral and the heathenism of the cathars cancel out!

Respuesta 2:
^
No. Scoring cities are exactly the same for both 1st and 3rd _except_ for "small cities."

The small city rule in 1st edition discouraged a person from quickly closing a city. So a 2-tile city was only worth 1 point each. If that city was beseiged and closed, then yes, it would be worth 0 points. But off the top of my head, I can't remember what all of the tiles looked like. 2 of the tiles definitely required 2 other tiles to close it. So you could never have less than a 3-tile city.

In 3rd edition rules, they discarded this distinction and all cities, regardless of size, are worth 2 point per tile.

EDIT:

Looked up the tile distribution:



2 of the tiles indeed require at least 3 tiles to close it and therefore are not subject to 1st edition small cities rule. The other two could be closed off with only two tiles each. So in this case, a closed 2-tile beseiged city is worth nothing under 1st edition rules.



Tema 450: Rules Argument between friends... me vs. them.
Pregunta:
We had a big game of Carcassonne last night. Two of the players had played 1st edition basic Carcassonne, two were 'noobies' and myself and my wife have been playing Carcassonne for a month straight. I have researched all the rules and have the latest 3rd edition German rules. Yet we got in some heated arguments because my 4 friends did not agree with what they considered my interpretation of the rules when I tried to tell them that it isn't my interpretation, rather, the official rules. They looked at the official rules and disagreed with the definition of the word "extend."

Here are the scenario's and I would like some definite answers - am I RIGHT or am I WRONG?

1st Rule Question) You have a single-tile city. You have a Meeple on that tile. You place another tile that will END THAT CITY (ie a 2-tile city). I claim that's it, you score 4 points, move on to the next player. They claimed that, rulewise and following the logical order of gameplay that the rules lay down, you can place a Builder on that finishing tile, score on that 2-tile city, and then draw again (ie have a 2nd turn, the special ability of the Builder).

I tried to explain that's abusing the system - but we couldn't agree on a definition to "extend." I tried to tell them that if the 2nd city tile was an open tile, ie would allow you to continue to build THAT CITY (ie expand), then you can place a Builder and draw again - because the special ability of the Builder is to help you build THAT city. They believed that "extend" can include finishing the city, though I didn't understand that.

They also didn't understand why you couldn't play that way, yet you could finish a large city with a Builder, and then draw a 2nd tile. I explained that was different because you already HAD a Builder in the city, and you were already building that city. If you finish that city on the first turn (with the Builder), they you get a 2nd turn also.

Let me know if I'm wrong about that, too. Originally I had played that when you finish a city, the Builder doesn't give you a 2nd turn because that city is finished - but I later read that this is the exception because the Builder is *already* in play.

***

Ok, 2nd rule question: Scoring happens at the END of your turn. So why can't you do this:

There is a Tower next to a city that needs only ONE tile to finish. That city has 2 Meeples on it belonging to 2 different players. What I believe: If you place that final city piece, the city is finished and both players score equally.

What my friends interpreted (again via reading the rules in a specific order): You place the city tile, finishing the city. You place a tower piece (instead of a meeple) and CAPTURE the enemy Meeple that is in that city. You get all the points for that city since scoring happens at the end of the turn.

Again, I can understand strict turn order, etc. but from what I read about Carcassonne - when you "cap" (finish) a city, it's over, the meeples are removed and the city is scored. Now, dropping a Tower and taking a prisoner, then getting all the points for that city is a pretty cool tactic - but is it official?

Respuesta 1:
I'd probably have an argument with you over whether the third edition German rules are the official rules.

No help on the other questions except that you don't get the benefit of the builder on the turn you play the builder. That's in any of the four or five rulesets out there.

Respuesta 2:
Besides agreeing with Spielguy on the builder, you're right on #1 and wrong on #2.

I might call the German rules official if only because they've made an effort to seam the expansions together better than the American (English?) rules, even in the Big Box...

Respuesta 3:
1st question: you can add a Builder to the tile you are placing instead of placing a normal meeple. But the Builder must be placed on a road or city you already have a meeple in.

So you may place a Builder on the tile even if you are scoring a small city - BUT the Builder must be on the tile before your turn in order to give you a bonus turn. You cannot place the Builder and get a second turn during the same turn.

So technically you can add the Builder to the city you are closing, but it would have no relevance as he would be removed again immediately without having any use!



2nd question: you may always place a meeple on the tile you are placing. Placing a meeple must take place before you score - otherwise you wouldn't be able to score an empty city you are closing.

So yes, your friends may take the meeple in a city prisoner right after closing it BEFORE it is scored.

@Great Dane

Exactly right.

Respuesta 5:
The builder allow's you to have a second turn if you place a tile on a structure (road or castle)that the builder his already on or in. So by closing a 2 tiles castle, it's imposible because you had to place a knigth on the castle first tile before playing the builder on another tile. It would be the following tile (third tile) placed on that castle that would have permit the player to draw again. But since the castle was closed it's impossible to have that additional draw.

Respuesta 6:
Yep, everyone else who has posted has it right -- placing the builder only yields an extra turn on FUTURE turns where you add to the builder's city or road.

Also, your friend's interpretation of the finished city/tower process is correct. It may be easier to remember that *every* turn happens in this order: Place tile, place meeple/pig/tower, score completed features.

That sequence of events is consistent in every Carcassonne ruleset ever printed.

Good luck!

Respuesta 7:
If it were allowed to get an extra turn by placing a builder at the finishing tile it could be abused massively.

Just think about it - why would I risk losing my builder due to a box-in if I could just cheaply plant it whenever I finish up a city/road? It would be a free extra turn without ANY risk for the builder. Quite stupid.

As for which version of the rules is used, that't best agreed upon before the game. Both the 1st and 3rd edition rules can be considered "official". My personal opinion is that the 3rd ed rules should always be used except when playing the original Carcassonne without any expansions, where the 1st ed perhaps works better. But if other players disagree, hey, 1st edition fine by me, just don't even think about trying to make me count all those farmers for every single town .

Respuesta 8:
Ok, good to know. Well, the reason I thought after you placed a Builder you immediately get a second draw was I was thinking of placing the Meeple as your "first turn" and then on your next turn the Builder lets you automatically begin trying to build that city. But if its Turn 1, Meeple, Turn 2, Builder, Turn 3, extra tile if you build on that city/road, then that's what it is =)

1st Rule Question) You have a single-tile city. You have a Meeple on that tile. You place another tile that will END THAT CITY (ie a 2-tile city). I claim that's it, you score 4 points, move on to the next player.

You know, I usually have no trouble with 1st/3rd edition confusion, but I kinda have to wonder why Rio Grande so stubbornly refuses to give up the 1st edition rules.

I mean, the designer of the game made all the expansions with the new rules in mind. If there weren't Rio Grande, there wouldn't even be this "editions". So if expansions provide new stuff, why wouldn't they provide new rules? What do you get by sticking to the "old rules", especially if you put the Big Box in the equation which is essentially Carcassone with almost ALL the new stuff added?

2-point small city I can live with. It's truly a minor difference. But per-city farm counting when using such a huge number of tiles is not just quite hard to visually acknowledge during the game, but is horribly tedious to count after the game (and for me long endgame point counts are quite a downers, and as interesting as filling out a tax return form).

I remember one game where we had to succumb to 1st edition rules (because the game owner was one stubborn you-know-what), and after the final tile was set there was this huge city with five sprawling farms around it, with pigs and river'n'all. We had to count, count and then recount all the meeples involved in farming for that city. It took FOREVER and in the end noone really cared who won.

Before that session, I was quite content with using either "official" ruleset, but now if expansions are involved, I'm 3rd edition all the way. Games should be fun, after all.

I have to disagree. As more expansions are designed with the 3rd Edition rules in mind, it makes less sense to keep trying to apply the translations to the 1st edition.

If there are those who picked up only the base game as casual gamers, then your sentiments are valid - let well enough alone. But for those of us who continue to get the expansions, updating the English rules to 3rd edition makes sense.

Yes, we can still figure it out - especially with the help of the Geek. But what I have found is that when I am teaching people new to the game, I use the 3rd edition rules because it is all I will play anymore. Then they go out and purchase the games and get very confused when they read the 1st edition rules.

It also makes it difficult playing with those that have a rule question and say - see it says right here in the rules.... and I have to say, yes, but those aren't the "real" rules!

My biggest gripe is that 1st Edition simply doesn't work too well with later expansions. The number of tiles grows, the cities become too large, the fields too numerous and what was admiteddly in vanilla Carcassone quite an easy task (counting the farm meeples on per-city basis) becomes needlessly tedious and frustrating.

To be frank, I'm not too fond of meeple farm counting in the 3rd edition, but at least it's managable. Using all the Big Box expansions together with the 1st edition is pure horror for the final-point-counting dude. Is "avoiding confusion" a good enough excuse for making the game less fun??

You're not getting what we are saying. And maybe it is because you have the 3rd edition rules in your language of choice while those of us with a gripe are Americans having to deal with the RGG ruleset.

Even if we didn't know about BGG or the 3rd Edition rules or that there is a country called Germany, we would still have issues. The problem comes for those who continue to buy expansions here. RGG continues to have to revise expansion rules before they are translated into English.

The assumption is that HiG playtest their expansions and evertyhing works fine. But when Jay tweaks something to make a 3rd expansion idea fit with 1st Edition rules, I doubt it is getting properly play-tested. Even if it is, it is creating loopholes for _later_ expansions.

When I started with Carcassonne, I knew about both rule editions. And knowing that I would be buying RGG's versions, my girlfriend and I decided to start with the 1st edition rules exclusively. As we added each expansion, it became more and more difficult to keep with the 1st Edition rules. It worked great with plain Carcassonne, but by the 4th or 5th expansion, the whole system seemed to collapse on itself. There were conflicts and no easy way to remember the rules.

The rules were like a person that told a little lie. And then had to lie again to cover up the first lie. And then lie to cover up the 2nd. And so on. When it was all done, the story looked nothing like the original. If people know nothing of BGG, then they have no clue what the original story was, but they know they are being fed a line of bull.

I think Jay missed the boat on the Big Box. He had the opportunity to right everything and create harmony among the world. He should have used the 3rd edition rules in the Big Box set and got everything caught up with Germany. Those that had previous editions could still play with 1st edition as much as they like. And going forward, all american versions would line up with HiG. At the very least, Jay could recognize that many Americans use 3rd Edition and facilitate it by posting 3rd Edition rules on his website.

Respuesta 20:
Okay, I see. I have use a mix of German and English expansions, but haven't seen the big box yet.

Why not? I enjoy playing with all the expansions. My friends do too.

The fact that you can mix and match expansions as you like doesn't automatically mean that you cannot play with them all at once if you want. On the other hand, the fact that 1st edition rules play horribly when using all the expansion is probably a good argument AGAINST using them, not FOR.

I've moved this quote to the top because I wanted to start off by saying that I completely agree with Brian here. The RGG Big Box should have also included the 3rd edition rules just to be consistent with the most current German rules.

My wife and I use the 1st edition rules, but we only play with basic + River I + I&C + T&B + Mini Expansion. Yes, it takes more time and you need to be really careful when scoring farmers as more tiles are added to the basic game, but we find it more challenging than tedious... and we like the extra layer of strategy that the 1st edition rules have over the 3rd edition rules.

Now, we have not played with P&D, Tower etc... Could you please explain how the "system seemed to collapse on itself" when you played with the 1st edition rules and those expansions? I'm not disputing you, I'm just trying to understand as I haven't played with them. Is it because those expansions add more city tiles, so you need to play with 3rd edition rules to make farmers worth more points to keep more of a scoring balance between the different types of followers?

Other than the pig in T&B, the only other expansion that I know of that affects farmer scoring is the Cathars -- is that the one that you mean causes "conflicts and no easy way to remember the rules" or am I missing something?

Just one last comment... people don't like the fact that RGG keeps the 1st edition rules, but it isn't like all of the German rules are universally loved either. For example, I've seen lots of posts that complain about how difficult it is to score and keep track of the King and Robber Baron.

I'm not disputing you, I'm just trying to understand as I haven't played with them. Is it because those expansions add more city tiles, so you need to play with 3rd edition rules to make farmers worth more points to keep more of a scoring balance between the different types of followers?
It all boils down to a matter of preference.

If you (and the friends you play with) are content with 1st Edition rules and find them acceptable when playing Carcassonne with any expansions - or all of them for that matter - then all is well and there is no huge reason whatsoever to adapt to the new ruleset.

But the fact stands that all the Carcassone expansions after the vanilla game were designed with the 3rd Edition rules in mind, and that RGG changes the original rules when translating them to english. Noone can dispute this. Now count the fact that Klaus Wurde probably heavily playtests the new expansions before releasing them - with the 3rd Edition rules of course - and that the changed RGG versions probably don't get playtested at all. I highly doubt they take the new expansions, try the 1st Edition rules, try the 3rd Edition rules, and then say "Hey, let's stick with the 1st Edition, those rules really work much better". They just change it, explain it's for the reasons of consistency and that's that.

As I said, you're free to choose whichever edition you like. I think that 3rd Edition are objectively much better, and that people who are sticking to the old rules should at least try to use the new ones for a session or two and see the reasons why they were changed in the first place. If you still prefer the 1st, no biggie. There is no reason for a big debate.



@kumasawa
Just one last comment... people don't like the fact that RGG keeps the 1st edition rules, but it isn't like all of the German rules are universally loved either. For example, I've seen lots of posts that complain about how difficult it is to score and keep track of the King and Robber Baron.
I really don't understand this part. What do King and Robber Baron have to do with farmer socring rules??



Tema 451: Town question
Pregunta:
Yesterday we played Carcassonne for the first time. So this might be a quite dumb question but it lead to a disagreement. Here it is:

RED has a uncompleted town. BLUE adds a tile which completes the town.

Can he put a meeple on it (and so score as well)?



This morning I was thinking about it and my conclusion was that BLUE can not do that, as one can not, for example, add a road tile to someone's road and mark it with his thief.

Could anyone confirm that?

Respuesta 1:
You can only put a meeple on a tile that is not part of an existing (claimed) town, so in this case BLUE can't place his meeple and claim a share of the points.

You are correct -blue CAN NOT place a meeple. However... playing deviously, he could conceivably have drawn a different tile that would allow him to place it against the grass, and possible extend INTO the city. He can then place a meeple on that, as long as it is not yet part of the city. Then, if he draws the right tile he could unite the two parts and not only enlarge the city, but now have a presence in it.

Respuesta 3:
Correct. The basic gist of Carc is that you can't directly join in on someone's object - their meeple "claims" it for them. You have to be sneaky and weasel in on it by placing your tile and meeple in a way that is not yet connected to the object (after which time your goal is to draw the other tile(s) you need to connect it up).



Tema 452: I don't get "Builders and Farmers" please explain...
Pregunta:
Ok, so I've played the original Carcassonne, I've added "The River I" and today added seamlessly "Inns and Cathedrals" (winning, mind you, with an awesome 30 point city thanks to a Cathedral!), but I don't get the "Builders and Farmers" expansion though I plan on playing it next game session... I need people to explain it to me.

I didn't understand the whole builder aspect. I get you place a tile with a knight/thief, but then I'm lost lol

One example in the rules said you have to place a 2nd tile, then your third tile can be placed with a Builder, but another example showed after a tile was placed with a knight/thief, the very next tile placed can be placed with a Builder. Which is correct?

Now, after you place a Builder, you can immediately draw a 2nd tile and place it anywhere. If you don't complete the road/city, every turn you can draw 2 tiles.

Ok, I got that (though that seems to change the scheme of gameplay... why ever finish that road/city?), but another example showed something like this:

Place road tile/thief. Next round, place road tile with builder. Immediately draw again... place road tile/city tile, finish road, IMMEDIATELY remove builder, you can draw another tile and place with Builder.

I think.

VERY CONFUSED.

Please simlipy and also tell me about the pigs. It seems if you place your pig down, that's it. It stays for the rest of the game... not much strategy there except to place it where there are a lot of cities and your farm...

Respuesta 1:
As far as I have always played, once the builder is added to a city or road, upon the next tile placement you do which adds to the city or road the builder belongs to you get to draw and place a second tile. That's it.

Respuesta 2:
Right, the builder just helps you quickly complete a city or road. However, a Builder (unlike other meeples) must go in a city or on a road that already contains another meeple (knight/thief).

On the turn after you place the builder, any time that you add to that city or road, you draw another tile and play it immediately. As long as you add the first tile to the feature with the Builder you get a 2nd tile - even if you complete the city or road.

The reason you want to complete those features is so that you can use the builder again and again. If you get him into a city that never closes, then he is trapped there and unable to help you.

A sample turn would be
Turn 1) Place a tile, place a knight in the city
Turn 2) Place a tile to extend the city, place your builder
Turn 3a) Place a tile to extend the city,
Turn 3b) Place a 2nd tile
Turn 4a) Place a tile to close the city,
Turn 4b) Score the closed city, take back meeples
Turn 4C) Place a 2nd tile (possibly place another meeple)

Respuesta 3:
Pigs and builders are pretty simple:

(1) Whenever a player could place a meeple, the player may instead place a pig or builder in a feature where he as at least one meeple.

(2) A new step is added to each player's turn after scoring (and after Cathar escape and Carcassonne City follower placement and Count movement): If the just-placed tile extended or completed a feature that contained the placing player’s builder, he must take one complete additional turn (not including this step).

(3) When fields are scored, any scoring fields containing a player's pig score an additional point. (Added before any doubling from a Cathar.)

Otherwise pigs and builders are treated like meeples, except that pigs and builders don't count towards determining the majority for scoring.

That's it.

Let's say you're building a city.

1) you place first city tile, and put a Knight on it.
2) you place second city tile, and place a Builder on it.
3) you *immediately* draw a 2nd tile, and get a road, which you place somewhere else.
4) next turn, you draw, getting a city tile with a road on it. You place it in your Builder City.

Ok, here is my question:

Can you PLACE a thief on that road, then draw a 2nd tile, or if you draw that 2nd tile, do you FORFEIT placing a meeple on that first tile? Then when the 2nd tile, you can place a meeple on that one since that is your "last" tile from the double draw?

We were playing like that, and were getting LOTS of points, so we figured that was the way to play - either:

1) place one tile and place a meeple on it, or
2) place one tile in Builders City/Road, and the immediately draw 2nd tile to place and then put meeple on.

Ummm.. I think you've made quite a devastating mistake in your first scenario. You DO NOT get an extra turn when placing the builder, you get an extra turn when building up the feature that ALREADY HAS THE BUILDER ON IT. So on your first turn you place the meeple, on the next one place the builder, and only on your third subsequent turn which involves the feature you can get an "extra turn".

The difference is significant, because if you play the way you mentioned the builder could be exploited massively - a clever player would keep it in the hand and use it only when finishing a structure, giving him an extra tile with the builder never actually getting on the playfield.

Tema 453: Do you have to use the Starting Tile as the Starting Tile?

Respuesta 5:
The official start tile has city, road, and grass (farmland) exposed
on its four sides. This guarantees the next tile draw can be played
off the start tile. Choosing a random tile may not allow the second
tile to be played legally.

Choosing a different start tile that preserves the three
road/city/farm exposures would be a viable option IMO.

mikey.

Respuesta 6:
We ALWAYS use the River and River-II expansions to begin our games. It gives us a chance to set the mood for the game as we each analyze our opponent's mental state and determine which strategy du jour to utilize. I've only started that "Starting Tile" when playing the original Basic Carcassonne game (only, with NOO expansions) at gaming Conventions where strict adherence to the Rules as published by RGG and included in the box was required for consistency. When you are playing at home, you can try every deviation from the norm that you can imagine and report your session here on BGG for feedback. As a variation, I've been thinking of dumping all of the 24 River tiles into the bag and then playing them randomly as they are drawn.

Respuesta 7:
As has been pointed out, not only does it allow a 2nd tile to be guaranteed playable (and also increases the chances that the 3rd, 4th, and so on can come into play), but it also allows everyone to get started on some feature by placing a meeple. The start tile gives you 4 features - a city, a road, and two fields. So most people should get to claim something and not get blocked out. If you drew a tile with just a city and a field, only 2 different players could build off of that until more features were placed.

And another obvious reason is that the back is different. Some people play with a bag, which would hide it. But our group still prefers stacks of tiles.



Tema 454: Farmer/Small City Scoring-Which method gives better gameplay
Pregunta:
Hello,

I know the issue of scoring variations has been discussed quite a bit in these forums (I just read all of it), but wanted to ask one more question on the subject before I take up this game.

My understanding is that one big reason for the change of the farmer scoring rule (to make the scoring farm-based, instead of city-based) and small-city scoring rule (4 points, instead of 2) was to simplify the rules. My question is, simplicity aside, which ruleset makes for a more interesting game?

My initial thinking is that some of the strategy fun may have been sacrificed to have simpler rules. (I don't particularly have a problem with complicated rules, so that's OK... ) But then I read that all the expansions were designed with the simplified scoring in mind, so perhaps the gameplay fun would be lessened by using the simplified scoring rules.

Your thoughts?

Respuesta 1:
The reason why many of us have accepted the official 3rd edition rules is that they work just as well as the original rules, but are easier to explain. If we thought the old rules were better would we have continued to play that way.

I don't mind which set of rules people ask me to play with - I haven't noticed any real difference. You will naturally try to close more 2-cities if they only score 2-points, and you will have to pay more attention to the farmers when playing with the original farmer rule, but at the end of the game I don't mind which way we played.

Agreed. The 3rd edition rules make farm scoring consistent with the scoring of other features so that it is much easer to explain and implement.

Respuesta 4:
My wife and I are very new to the game (we've only been playing since Christmas) but we have tried both the original farmer scoring rules (included in our RGG Big Box) and the 3rd edition rules (from Matthew Harper's Annotated Rules pdf on this site).

We seem to be in the minority in preferring the original rules. We like the fact that 2-tile cities earn only 2 points because it encourages the building of bigger cities. We like the original farmer rules because it just seems logical that all farms bordering a city should have to "compete" to get the points for that city, and it also makes sense that a city should just be worth a set amount of points that is not determined by the number of farms surrounding it. It may take a little longer to calculate the farmer points, but it doesn't seem like a big deal to us. Definitely not annoying to calculate.

I don't think the original farmer rules are ideal -- for example, I'm not entirely convinced that small cities should earn the farmer the same 4 points as a larger city -- but they make the game more interesting because the scoring isn't exactly the same as it is for the other features, and it requires a little more observation and strategy to earn the points.

By the way, so far we have played with basic + River 1 + I&C + T&B. Do any of the other expansions change the game in such a way that it becomes clear that we should switch to 3rd edition scoring rules? We are gradually introducing expansions so P&D and Tower are coming up soon.

Respuesta 5:
In my experience, if you play the most popular expansion set (vanilla+I&C+T&B) then the cities are already so heavily featured the difference in small city point value is almost non-existent in final scoring. 4-point is more consistent with the ruleset so I use that one.

As for the incentive to build bigger cities, well if trade goods, cathedrals and gazillion of city tiles aren't incentive enough, I really don't see the significance of "small city punishment". Small city spammage tactic perhaps can work in the original Carcassone, but with expansions it's utterly pointless.

Oh, and concerning the farmers, 3rd edition all the way. Later expansions were developed with those rules in mind, so for me it's a bit more logical to use them instead of the original ones. Not to mention that playing the original rules with expanded set can make end-game scoring needlessly tedious. In fact the only reason there are this "editions problems" is that Rio Grande refuses to include new rules for the sake of consistency. Plenty of people like to play the game as-it-says-in-the-box (me included) and it's kinda hard to break the habit once you're accustomed to one way of playing.

Tema 456: carcassonne: scoring incomplete pieces help
Pregunta:
hello, there is probably a thread on this already so forgive me if there is because i couldn't find it. I've been playing carcassonne recently and was wondering if anyone could clear up a query i have with the scoring of incomplete roads, cities etc. See the trouble is in version of the rules i have it clearly says that EVERY SEGMENT OF THE INCOMPLETE ROAD, CITY OR CLOISTER SCORES 1 POINT. this seems odd to me because if this is the case then there is no real incentive to finish the road or cloister other than to claim back your follower, whereas with an incomplete city you are punished significantly often scoring less than half of the points that you normally would have. Am i scoring this correctly? any help would be great, thanks

Respuesta 1:
You're playing the game correctly as I understand the rules.

Respuesta 2:
It's true. Incomplete cities, roads, and cloisters score one point per segment. You do not score for pennants in incomplete cities. If you play with the Inns and Cathedrals expansion, incomplete cities containing cathedrals and incomplete roads with inns on the lakes do not score any points. Farmers score only for completed cities.

Respuesta 3:
You are correct. The incentive is definitely to claim back the meeple. Think of it this way: say you have a meeple sitting on an incomplete cloister that scores 8 points at the end of the game. For its entire "life", that meeple is only worth 8 points. On the other hand, if you can finish that cloister (or road, etc), claim him back, then reuse him for a city or farmer, his value will have increased substantially to maybe 20 points by the end of the game!

If you're playing the game without Inns & Cathedrals, then yes, you're scoring it correctly. You are correct that the main incentive to complete roads and cloisters is to receive your meeple back, however by game end--no big deal. I believe the rules are differently for the castles since that's the main part of the game--complete them. (Since the real city of Carcassonne is a walled city, that's probably the reason.)

If you're using the Inns & Cathedrals expansion, then if there is an Inn (house on the lake) by the road or a Cathedral in the castle, then it's all or nothing. If completed, the road increases to 2 points per section and if not complete, it's 0. The castle would be three points per section and three points per pennant if complete with a cathedral and 0 if incomplete. It sounds like you should play this expansion to make road completing a higher incentive.

I beleive this is 1 point per tile, not segment, ie. if the uncompleted castle has two seperate castle sections on the tile then it only counts as 1 point for the tile, not two points for two segments.

For example the third collumn down the last two tiles on the right. 1 point per tile, not per castle segment.

It doesn't matter how many times you claim back your meeple. What difference would it make to complete a road if you already have a meeple you could place somewhere else? Unless it is very important to "block" an opponents move, ideally you would want to score as many points per tile. The key is making sure you complete the features that award more points completed than if they weren't (like cities). It's not so much, specifically, about meeple reclamation.

I pretty much implicitly covered that scenario. Assuming your opponent doesn't nullify your feature by also competing it... Etc. I'm saying meeple reclamation doesn't have much impact. Just don't run out when you need to try to block/steal an opponents feature if your hand is forced, or if you see a late-game scoring chance (with a farmer, e.g.)

Respuesta 16:
How about the case of your opponents intentionally playing tiles in a way that prevents you from reclaiming your meeps? Now you have no more meeps to play.

Respuesta 17:
That is the ONLY scenario where getting a meeple back is important. You would obviously want to avoid a scenario where all your meeples are blocked where you cannot reclaim them. Duh. This scenario would mean that you can't score anymore except at the end of the game.
Meeples on the board at the end of a game is obviously a good thing, but you certainly would not want it to be for incomplete city features.
Reclaiming meeples in and of itself does not matter. What matters is not getting them blocked on city features because you cannot complete your city feature and get its full 2 points. You will be stuck with the 1 point per tile at the end of the game. If it is a road, it's not a big deal because you will still get the usual # of points. Completing a road feature does not provide any advantage unless you absolutely need that meeple back because all others are blocked.
The point is- complete the features before you get blocked in. The only scenario where GETTING YOUR MEEPLE BACK is at all important is if you got yourself in a situation where almost all of your meeples are blocked.

Respuesta 18:
We have started playing with the travel edition, maybe that one's manual is a bit unclear, but we got several rules wrong.

- We don't score partial territories at all. This gives a strong incentive to close them until the end. Last game the final card actually scored about 24 points, which for sure decided the game.
- We allow to place another meeple if you add to a territory you own (or share). This allows for interesting takeover quarrels.
- We count segments, not tiles.

Meanwhile we've looked at the offical rules - and decided to stay with our house rules. We consider them to be more interesting and more logical.

What we don't like is how points are counted when there is meeple parity on a territory. It would make sense to split the points between the "winning" parties in such a case instead of giving all of them the full points. But then we also need to define a rounding rule.

Tema 457: does a bridge terminate a road?
Pregunta:
Does the tile with the bridge going over a river terminate a road the way a junction does? The rules do not explicitly list the bridge as a terminating tile, and the rules for the river tiles are a terse paragraph at the end that don't address this.

Respuesta 1:
I believe (NOT based on any rules I have read) that the road going over the bridge does continue -- after all, that's what a bridge does.

That said, there is a related tile which has one road going over another road. Do BOTH of them continue, even the one underneath the bridge? I would think they do, but our gaming group had some debate about it and no clear ruling.

Respuesta 2:
A bridge doesn't end a road. It doesn't matter if it goes over a river or another road. The road below the bridge continues also.

Respuesta 3:
They both continue on the double road tile. The under and over roads remain intact.

Respuesta 4:
I wasn't sure about this until I noticed that one of the tiles on the river expansion shows a monastery on one side of the river with a road crossing perpendicularly over the river via a bridge.

If the bridge ended the road, then there would be a whole section of road contained entirely within one tile - from the monastery to the bridge. This seems entirely illogical to me.

I therefore have played since then with the rule that the bridges do not end roads.

Respuesta 5:
I also agree that the bridge does not terminate a road.



Tema 458: Scoring question
Pregunta:
At the end of the game, would this knight score 4 points or 6 points?

Respuesta 1:
Four. The other city tiles are not considered to be connected to this city.

Respuesta 2:
I would say 4. The outer two are not technically connected to the city. Even though there is no way to lay a tile that wouldn't connect them to it.

That's not true, actually. There is a tile, maybe it is in the first expansion, that has a city "end" on each of its four sides with a field in the middle. If placed there it would keep these existing city pieces from connecting.

Respuesta 4:
A city is not connected when the only "connection" is corner to corner. It has to be side by side.

Respuesta 5:

Yes, 4. "Connected" means connected along an edge, depicting the same feature.

It isn't explicitly stated in the rules. However it not explicitly stated that you could jump over holes or score tiles that are connected by the corners (what a large Field I could score!)- so, which part of the rules gave you the idea that you could do that?

Respuesta 8:
Mik Svellov
@Great Dane
"so, which part of the rules gave you the idea that you could do that?
Since the rules didn't specify this kind of situation, not stating either way, I reasoned since (in the basic edition) no tiles other than city tiles can be placed in the missing area all tiles counted toward the uncompleted city. I believe it is a reasonable assumption. I am just curious how others felt.

Also, there may be errata or a FAQ somewhere that I haven't seen that may address this specific situation, since the rules do not.

If you go to the carcassonne main page (search for carcassonne, then click on the base game), click the 'files' link in the game info section, which will get you to a list of downloadable files.

A very nice resource to have

Respuesta 10:
Is there anything in the rules that suggest that if no other tile could fit in the gap that scoring for this set up would be anything other than 4?

I though making opponents cities uncompleteable was part of the game strategy.

Respuesta 11:
I agree that in this case, the three "bits of city" are unconnected (they should be edgesharing as said above). It does raise the question as to what happens if there is a gap in the middle of a city that doesn't involve corner sharing tiles...

Respuesta 18:
Thanks everyone for your input. In the spirit of the rules my above example is not a complete city. Furthermore, at the end of the game the knight scores 4 points as the upper middle and left city pieces are touching only by the corners, not by the edges.

Still, it does bother me why they couldn't put in the rule book an example of scoring a city somewhat like this, not to mention actually mention the word "edges" in it. As it is, the rules for scoring incomplete cities at the end of the game are vaguely put: "For each incomplete road and city, the player, who has a thief on the road or knight in the city, earns one point for each road or city segment."

Anyway, thanks again. The above example was similar to something in our first playing of the game.



Tema 459: Cloister on river tile?
Pregunta:
I have a quick question on one of the tiles that is part of the river set of tiles that comes with the main game. There is one tile that has what looks to be a cloister on it.

My wife thinks it's just decoration and not a true cloister where as I disagree as the building looks the same as the cloisters in the main game although a bit smaller.

So what do you guys think? Cloister or no cloister?

Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
It's a Cloister!

Respuesta 2:
Definitely a cloister, just with humble monks who like to fish a lot. For some reason it's one of my favorite tiles.

Tema 460: Crossroads?
Pregunta:
So, my wife and I played our new copy of Carcassonne and we had a question about one of the tiles. It's the one that has a little city segment and a t-intersection of roads with some trees around the intersection. For reference, it's the fourth row and fourth column of this image: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/115467

The question is, is this a "crossroads" as mentioned in the rules, (like the fifth row, third column), or is it something else? Specifically, does it constitute three road segments that all terminate in the trees, or is it just a continuous road? Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
Well, I found the annotated rules file on here and I think I found the answer to my own question. It IS a "crossing" and constitutes three separate road segments. Thanks me.

Tema 461: Can you create "holes"?
Pregunta:
Just to be absolutely sure: are you allowed to place tiles so that "holes" are created - holes could become rather big?
My rules don't specifically say something about this while eg Alhambra does not allow it.

I assume yes as I have seen pictues of finished games where there were holes

Respuesta 1:
Yes you can.

With the right tiles, they can always be filled in later.

If you're really lucky and pick up a perfect fit with a Cloister on it, it's an instant 9 points (if it was a single hole)


N.

Respuesta 2:
Holes are not just allowed, they are common. A well-known tactic is making a tile-sized hole when every tile that could fill it has already been played, so as to lock up an opponent's meeple for the rest of the game.

Respuesta 3:
Only to make it clear, you can´t score any points on the structures containing the hole. So if you have a big city with a wall all around it but a hole in its interior, you can´t score that city.



Tema 462: Farmers tied, does player with the pig score extra points?
Pregunta:
We generally play with 2 people and the newer 3 point German farm scoring rules.

If you have a farm with an even number of meeples from both players but only one has a pig, how do you handle this?
Obviously they would both score, but does the person with the pig get +1 point per city? (This is how we've been doing it)

The rules aren't quite clear. They just say the pig only counts if you win the farm. In this case you aren't really winning the farm, but you are scoring from it.

Respuesta 1:
we play the same way that you do and score the extra point for the pig

Respuesta 2:
A connected point: if you are using a pig-herd tile from either The River II or the GQ mini-expansion, and the tile is contained within the farm that is tied, then both (or all) players who tie score the bonus from that, and not just the player with the pig.…

Without pig or pig-herd; 3 points each.
One player has a pig: that player scores 4 points, the other 3
There's a pig-herd, and one player has a pig: that player scores 5, the other 4.

You're using 3rd edition scoring, so those points should be correct.

Respuesta 3:
This may be different with the RGG rules set. Those rules still use the first edition scoring. The rules also state that you must own the farm in order to use the pig.

With first edition scoring, this can be confusing because you are totaling all the farmers touching the scoring city.

So, here's a scenario. If Blue has two farmers (in separate farms) touching the same city and Green has one farmer with one of the Blue farmers, then Blue will score for that city. But what if Blue has a pig in the same farm as Green's farmer? I know Blue will score 4 points for having total majority, but can he get the extra point for the pig even though he doesn't "own" that particular farm?



Tema 463: Farm confusion (again)


Tema 464: Carcassonne - Complete Annotated Rules
Pregunta:
Just putting the finishing touches to the translation of the Big Box rules (which means that my girlfriend is proofreading it). I mentioned on the thread dealing with that (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1200987) the idea of doing a complete annotated rule set for Carcassonne including, well, whatever we think is necessary. The Big Box rules are a good basis for doing this, since they bring RGG and HiG rules a little more into line than they were before, and include a couple of changes which make all the expansions more compatible than before (builders and pigs are not followers any more - they can't be move to the city of Carcassonne, or put on top of towers). For an overview of the changes see this post: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1200987#1200987. And, because of the more standardised rules, a number of the FAQ from my site (http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com) are obviously out-of date. So it seems like a good time to go through everything an try to create a standard up-to-date set of rules and FAQ which can be used as a reference. At least, that's the idea.

The translation of the Big Box rules is currently available as a pdf from my website (http://homepage.mac.com/mjharper/BigBoxTranslation.pdf) - I'll update that link after it's submitted to BGG.

So: what would you like to see included? Can you help out with anything - comparing rules, proofreading, compressing pdfs? What do you think?

I have a practical question about the translations of the mini-expansion rules for a start. The Big Box standardises the presentation of the rules for each expansion according to the basic game procedure:

1: Place a tile
2: Deploy a follower
3: Score completed feature
--
Final scoring

This makes a great deal of sense when trying to combine all the expansions. However, the mini-expansions don't use this method. So the practical question is: When translating the mini-expansions, should I stick precisely to the original layout, or adapt the text to fit the standard Big Box approach? I don't think that would entail many changes to the text, and it would make integration easier, but it might also offend the purists out there. Any thoughts?

Also, should the expansions be organised by release date, or big expansions, then small expansions?

Respuesta 1:
Simply put, if you're using the RGG rules which came with the original release of the games, you aren't using the newest RGG rules.

The English Big Box set does contain consolidated rules rather than just a compilation of the old rules. I started a thread dealing with this here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/133953.
The table below summarises the various sets:

A '?' means I don't yet know what the RGG Big Box rules have to say about the issue. The problem is however, that RGG have changed some rules, such as builders and pigs not being followers anymore (as in the HiG Big Box), corrected others, such as meeples on towers being allowed to be captured (as they always were in HiG rules), and left some unchanged, such as 1st edition farmer scoring and small cities. The whole aim of the complete annotated rules is to comprehensively describe the most current set of rules and highlight the differences between sets…

Alright, does that mean taht the RGG BB has the most recent RGG version rules then?
If so, I may go ahead and get it...
(Plenty of people I can hand off the old sets to...)

And as a clarifier, my RGG editions are the most recent RGG printings.
Does that mean I have the most recent RGG rules?
As far as I know, the Big Box editions contain new and updated rules for both RGG and HiG. That's one reason for doing the translations - so that everyone can easily fing out what the new rules are, what with RGG not offering rules for download. And in my translation of the Big Box rules, I've pointed out where the two editions differ.

Ophidian
wrote:
And finally, anything major that one might trip over integrating the small expansions into the RGG BB, or does its rule set already cover those?
I'm translating the mini-expansions at the moment, and I'll be in a better position to answer that when I've finished (later today, I hope). I don't anticipate any major issues, although there were a some of questions about how builders and pigs could be used in The Count of Carcassonne. For example, under the old rules it was possible to place a builder or pig in the City of Carcassonne to be parachuted in at a later point - because they were followers. That's no longer the case.

The essential rule change is that builders and pigs are not followers any more - other than being eaten by the dragon, which eats pretty much everything, the rules governing them and followers are entirely different. Bear this in mind, and you'll be fine.

Doesn’t include Aldaron’s summary or distribution sheets, and the page on the GQ expansion looks a bit empty - no rules or translate (no rules at all, in fact), although there are a couple of FAQ from other expansions which seem relevant.

I haven't included all of the FAQ from my website (http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com) since a large number of them have now been incorporated into the Big Box rules, and a great many others are now out of date - especially those concerning the builder and pig, which aren't followers any more. If anyone thinks any that I've omitted should be included, please let me know.

As always, any feedback most appreciated.

Took a bit longer than expected, but the new version includes a consolidated tile reference, organised by type (farm, farm, city, road - ffrc - for example), tile distribution lists for every set except The Count of Carcassone (which doesn't need one), a couple of pages of variations from the offical carcassonne home page, and some more notes/observations on the GQ mini-expansion (apart from my comments in the footnotes, the only thing that's orginial text), as well as a number of layout changes. That brings the total pages to 52 at 4.9MB - the last version was 36 pages, and 4.4MB, so I don't think that's too bad…

Well, that's pretty much all for the moment. There's still a number of issues outstanding in the comparison between the HiG and RGG Big Box sets - see the table above for more info if you can help out. I have permission to include Aldaron's summary too… And there's a couple of things over at the home page I haven't included, like an interview with Klaus Jürgen Wrede, if anybody's interested.

Changed pages are (refers to pages in the new doc):
- Contents (two columns, not one, so only 3 pages). That means that the main text starts on page 5 instead of, er, 7 (?)
- p.13 (Tile Distribution for the basic game)
- p.14 (includes Tile Distribution for The River)
- p.17 (Tile Distribution for Inns and Cathedrals)
- p.21 (Tile Distribution for Traders and Builders)
- p.22 (includes Tile Distribution for King and Scout)
- p.25 (includes Tile Distribution for The Cathars)
- p.30 (Tile Distribution for Princess and Dragon)
- p.31 (includes Tile Distribution for The River II)
- p.33 (includes Tile Distribution for The Tower) - I don't think p.32 was affected
- p.35 (completely new notes, including Tile Distribution for the GQ miní-expansion)
- p. 38-52 are entirely new (consolidated tile reference, and selected variations)

A number of the other pages have had their layout moved around slightly, although the text hasn't been altered.

I'm sorry if the update causes anyone hassle… I thought that the consolidated tile reference would stand on its own, but I realised after I'd scanned all the tiles that I could go back through the rules and add in distribution lists for the individual games fairly easily…

Tema 465: New Rulings from HiG & The Big Box
Pregunta:
Hi everyone

I've been a bit out of circulation for the last few months, so I don't know if this is old hat. But I've been speaking to HiG about a couple of rules questions that arose ages ago, and learned that the Big Box not only includes a summary of the rules, but new rules. Is that really news to the geeks here, and could someone point me to the relevant threads if it's already been discussed?

Anyway on to the correspondence (translated from German). I asked the following two questions:

Matthew Harper
@mjharper
First: if the pig and builder count as followers, can they block other followers from being deployed to features? For example, if blue has a knight and a builder in a city, and the knight is somehow removed, does that mean that blue still 'occupies' the city, because the builder is still there (even though the builder doesn't count towards the majority)? Do all players (including blue) have to indirectly build onto the city, just as they would if they were trying to capture a city in which someone else already had the majority? Or can a knight simply be deployed there, as if the city was empty? In other words, although it's clear that builders and pigs don't count towards the majority, it isn't clear what role they play in the occupation of a city.

Secondly, can the builder and pig be moved to the City of Carcassonne? Naturally the pig could only be placed on the market, but still: is it possible?
The reply:

HiG
wrote:
Builders and pigs don't block either normal followers or other builders and pigs during deployment. And neither count towards the majority. (You were right, Aldaron - Matt)

'Builders and pigs are followers' refers to only one thing in terms of deployment. Only one follower (e.g. knight OR builder) can be deployed each turn, not one follower and, independently of that, a builder.
It also refers to removal by a princess or a tower. In this case it means that builders and pigs (like other followers) can be removed.

But now it gets complicated…

At the moment there are really two sets of rules that don't work together. In the newest rules we defined the builder and pig as 'special figures' that can no longer stand alone. So when the last related follower is removed, the pig and builder are automatically returned to the player.
Builders and pigs can also no longer be removed by towers or princesses.

The newest rules are at the moment only in the BigBox; the normal games only have the old rules at the moment.
So I wrote back:

Matthew Harper
@mjharper
Thanks for the info. Does that mean that the BigBox rules are a kind of 4th Edition? Are there any other new rules we should be aware of?

I've got two other questions, though:

1) I would expect that the new rules for the builder and pig also apply when they're eaten by the dragon - is that true?

2) How do the new rules affect my second question in my original mail - can builders and the pig be moved to the City of Carcassonne?
The second reply:

HiG
wrote:
Altogether we adapted a couple of rules.
The princess, for example, MUST remove ANOTHER's follower or your OWN.
With the tower, players CAN capture ANOTHER's follower.
- now in both cases: MUST and OWN or ANOTHER

Otherwise the most important change is with the builder.

To your questions:
1) Yes. Whenever the last follower (big or small) is removed from a feature in which the player has a builder or a pig, the builder and the pig are returned to the player.

2) I forgot to answer that! According to the old rules it was quite possible. But no one thought of doing so. With the newest rules it's no longer possible, because the pig and builder are not followers any more.
There's a download to the new rules (in German) here: http://www.hans-im-glueck.de/downloads/regel_bigbox.pdf

And the dragon still does eat the builders and pigs!

So, I'm really sorry if I've just been out of the loop for too long, and you all knew this already. But if not, the new rules seem like quite a shift, at least in details, which is what geeks are into.

And do we need a translation of the whole BigBox rule set?

Respuesta 2:
Just a quick clarification of the rules for the princess - according to the new rules she CAN remove one follower from the city in which she is placed - and that follower may be big or small. A couple of small changes there.

And towers are specifically allowed to 'capture' the player's own followers - they come straight back to the player.

I have a feeling that the second reply from HiG is in error - as far as I can see, the rules for both towers and princesses are now that they CAN remove a follower, with someone else's or their own, rather than MUST.

But that's all that seems to be different…

Respuesta 3:
Yeah, this is leaving me more confused than when I started. I'm surprised to hear him say that nobody's ever tried putting a pig or builder in Carcassonne city - I won a devastating victory in one game by placing my pig in Carc city, which allowed me to have it jump out at the end of the game and improve my biggest farm. Now, I can't see any use for placing the builder in Carcassone City...unless you're out of other meeples, and you really need to move the Count.

Barry Figrim
@beri
I'm surprised to hear him say that nobody's ever tried putting a pig or builder in Carcassonne city.
I think they meant when they wrote the rules originally. They had made that comment previously through Matt's website.

I am also confused by the confusion. It always stated the princess MUST remove a knight when the tile extended a city containing knights - even if you were the only one with the knight. The Tower always allowed you the option to capture or not. Now they are saying you MUST capture it with a tower. And if you "must" capture your own follower from a tower, then you just get the meeple back into your supply.

Is the confusion coming from the fact that the German rules are different than what they posted above? It seems by their language (and what to do with your own captured meeples) would tend to lean towards their statements here being correct - that you MUST capture instead of May capture.

Respuesta 5:
Actually, I think that the confusion about MAY and MUST is in the email I received from HiG. Georg was saying that they've standardised the procedure, and but I think he described the standardisation in the wrong way. As I added in my second post above, the new rules in the BigBox now say that the princess MAY remove a knight - and this is the rule that has changed. The princess now behaves like a tower, and not vice versa, as the email from Georg suggested.

Maybe I should write back and check that point again…

Respuesta 6:
Hey, I've also been out of the loop for a while but I was just wondering if you could translate the whole Big Box rules so we can look for differences.

Right, I've started on the translation - much to do. There's a PDF of the first two pages available at http://homepage.mac.com/mjharper/BigBoxTranslation.pdf No significant rule changes in there - I'll highlight any I come across - but any feedback and advice would be appreciated.

The pdf is 1.2MB - I'll compress it properly later.

I just looked over the PDF quickly... and it looks pretty much the same except for one big thing... 3 points per city a farmer supplies, vs 4 points for the US version.

I'm like 98% sure it was 4 points per city.


Ah found another one (in looking at the other past rule thread discussions)
A 2 segment city is only worth 2 points... not the adjusted 4.

Again, I'll check against my actual copy of the rules over the next couple of days.

Respuesta 16:
@ducker

Thanks!

I'll keep doing my translation, but it would be really helpful if you could let us know the following:

- Do the rules say that princesses must remove a follower (old) or may (new)? - Princess and Dragon.
- Do they say that pigs and builders are followers (old) or are not followers (new)? - Traders and Builders
- Do the rules say that followers on towers can (HiG) or cannot (RGG) be taken prisoner? - The Tower
- Do they say that 'small cities' score two points (old) or four points (new)? - Basic Game
(We already know from what you said that the farming rules in the RGG translation of the Big Box are the still the first edition)

As far as I know (so far) those are the principal differences. I'm curious to know which if any have changed in the RGG translation - did they just compile the old rules or did they update anything at all? Shame if they didn't - would have been the perfect opportunity.

Just what we need: not only are there three sets of farming rules, a mistranslation of a rule for The Tower, and the question of small cities, but it looks like we might now have to add Big Box (HiG version) and Big Box (RGG version) to the list of rules variations.

Oh, when will it end?!

[edit - Just seen your addition about small cities. My guess is that RGG just threw together all their old rules translations, and didn't even look at the updated rules that HiG had developed.]

Respuesta 17:
As I just tried Princess and Dragon this past friday I can safely say that it reads: "you MUST remove 1 follower."

I can check the other rules later... but so far it's 3/3 on the "old rules," and I'd wager you're right... they just went with the old set.

Respuesta 18:
Thanks… that helps a great deal. I'm trying to highlight whatever changes I find in the text so that we geeks out there can easily identify what's new and what's not. And part of that must be pointing out differences from even the RGG edition of the same collection.

I think RGG believe that it's better to leave the rules unchanged for the sake of consistency, but HiG update the rules frequently, to simplify them or improve integration with new expansions (the Big Box has 4 expansions, and there are 5 other mini-expansions, or 6 if you include the current GQ tile set). So you end up with a situation where whenever a new expansion comes out, RGG translate it, then correct it to make it backwards-compatible with the out-of-date rules that they haven't updated…

Well, I can see that it might be possible to argue that the RGG rules for the basic game might be 'better', but I find it difficult to see how one can argue that the game as a whole - all 9/10 expansions - is better for using the RGG rules, when every expansion released by RGG has to be 'corrected'. You might be able to argue that it is better to play the game as it was originally meant to be played, but then that is true for the expansions too - they were meant to be played with the later rules, and HiG sometimes adjusts them (or rather, simplifies them) to make the all the expansions fit together better.

I don't want to start a whole 'which is better debate', but no matter how much one thinks that the original RGG rules are better, it must be possible to concede that they weren't designed to be played with multiple combinations of expansions, and that unforeseen difficulties may arise. Not least when RGG introduces new rules through mistranslation…

Respuesta 21:
I very recently got a copy of the Big Box version of this game for my birthday. It's the RGG release, of course, and now that I've had a chance to sit down and read through the rules, here's what I've found:

First of all, "small" cities score only two points.

In your translation of the German version, the "small city" example on the bottom of page 5 says "RED scores 4 points." In my manual, it reads "Red earns 2 points (exception: a 2 tile city does NOT get 2 points per tile)"

That's the only reference the manual makes to the exception.

Additionally, they're still using the old farming rules: 4 points per city.

On the other hand, a lot of rules seem to fit the "new" list. A couple of quotes from the instructions:

"The pig is not counted for determining which player feeds a city. It is not a follower!"

"The builder does not count as a follower for determining follower majority on a road or city."

So apparently neither the pig nor the builder is a follower.

Also, even though this is the RGG version of the game, the rules regarding a follower on a tower state "This follower remains on the tower until the end of the game, unless it is removed by the dragon *or is taken prisoner by another player when he places a tower piece on another tower.*"

Finally, the section regarding princesses only has two things to say regarding princesses removing followers:

"If [a player] places the [princess] tile so that it adds to a city with one or more knights, he must return one of those knights to its player [...] If he places the tile so that it adds to an empty city, or only starts a new city, he may place a follower (or other figure) in the normal ways."

--So a princess MUST return a knight if and only if placed in an occupied city. I guess that corresponds with the old rules?

And yes, the dragons still eat pigs and builders.

Doesn't look like they've changed much, really, although there have certainly been a few refinements.

Thanks for that. You're right: the builder and pig aren't considered to be followers here, and that corresponds to the new HiG rules. The interesting thing is, however, that the sentence 'It is not a follower!' doesn't occur at that point in the German. Tell me: do the RGG Big Box rules contain a taxonomy at the very end as well? In the HiG rules, it's there that the rule is most clearly stated.

The tower ruling seems to correct the mistranslation in the original Tower rules, which makes sense.

But then, why wouldn't they adjust the rule for the princess if they changed the rules for pigs, builders and towers? That's a real hodgepodge.

But thanks a lot. I'll be able to point out the differences much more clearly now.

Respuesta 23:
Yeah...I'd forgotten to mention, but on the back of the manual it also says quite clearly that the pigs and builders aren't followers. That's in the "Game Figures" section next to the "Special figures" heading.

Took a while (been busy) but I've finished the translation of the basic game, Inns and Cathedrals and Traders and Builders.

Tema 466: Am I playing it right?
Pregunta:
Everyone's rating of this game is rather high but after playing with a few friends, we all agreed that it's not that great after all. But the point is are we playing it right?

Firstly, do we play the tiles the way the player (the person who picked the tile) the way that is most advantageous to him or he must place it at the best "location". Example does he link up the castle that is already building up or he tries to avoid it by placing it on the grass part?

Secondly, the rule book says that it's very rare to not be able to place a tile but for me, we find it very often where to comes a point where a tile cannot be placed on the last placed time. Eg. a tile with castle on three sides.

Thirdly, does most of you end the game with alot of points on incomplete stuff? Most of the time when we play towards our advantage, we often left everyone with lots of uncomplete road, cloister or castle.

Respuesta 1:
Placement of tiles is up to the player that draws it. Naturally, if he places it somewhere that he doesn't gain from it then it is likely a bad placement. So, in short (and barring some major plans involving thinking lots of rounds ahead) the player who draws the tile places it where he can benefit most from it.

It is indeed very rare not to be able to place a tile _anywhere_. However, if you are built in (lots of other tiles close by) then sometimes it is hard or impossible to place the last tile where you want it. That is also one of the strategic aspects of the game, you place your tiles where you benefit the most or where your opponents lose the most (and it is extremely good if both happen at the same time).

Yes, if people just hinder the completion of castles etc then it will be like you describe. Try with smaller areas and complete them faster.

Hope it helps. Carcassonne is all in all a pretty good game.

Respuesta 2:
If you are playing "by the rules", then I suspect that a veteran player would be quite helpful to your group. It's too easy to get caught up playing a certain way when nobody knows any better. Then when someone beats you badly over and over, you start to understand the possibilities. For example, I often see new players always attach the "feature" on the drawn tile to one on the board. You are allowed to play farm to farm as well.

Respuesta 3:
Hello,
Carcassone was my first game, and still today i enjoy playing it very much with my friends (we are always 5 ou 6 playing).
First of all, i'd say that the base game can get very basic after sometime, but the real deal is playing it with the first 3 ou all the 4 main expansions. That's when the game gets real interesting, exciting, fun with tactics and lots of different options.

As for your questions:
- yes you should always put the tile somewhere that will give you some advantage (directly like points to you, or indirectly like making someone's life more difficult). But always think about your best interests

- In all the games I played, we never drew tiles that could not be played. If you have a three sided castle and grass on the other side, you just need to connect it to a tile with grass or castle. There's always an option, even if it's not for a big advantage to the person playing it. Check the rules maybe you're mistaking some of the rules

- In the end, points from incomplete features depend alot on what sets you play. With the basic Carcassone, yes it's normal to have a lot of incomplete. With the 4 expansions, especially with the Dragon or The Tower, there's always few incomplete features, making the player make its plays on a more short-term basis or at least more strategical (example: it will be more difficult for farmers to survive the entire game).

I recommend you this site for answering any doubts:
http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2006/04/welcome.html

I just have one doubt of my own:

As long as the grass/road/city edges on all sides match, you can play a tile anywhere you like.

Other posters have basically said this same thing, but just to be sure (in case this is the way you are interpreting)... there is NO requirement to play a tile next to the tile played in the previous turn.

The requirements are that it be played next to at least one other previously played tile, and that it not "contradict" any of the features of adjacent tiles.

Respuesta 6:
A tile with city on 3 sides can still be placed grass edge against the grass of another tile. If you have more than one tile per game that you cannot play, then you are playing wrong somehow.

OMG! We played it wrongly! Definitely wrongly... I interpreted the rules as playing the drawn tile on a previously played... (my interpretation was... You must place the tile you draw with at least one side touching a previously paced (I interpret it as the last placed tile). Ok I think the game is going to be much better from now on.

In my experience it has happened exactly once in over twenty games. Somebody drew a "four-way roads" tile, and as it happened there was only one incomplete road and it led to a position adjacent to a non-road edge from another tile.

Huh? You'd have to admit that a river splits a farm into two right, just as a road does?

BUT look at the images: The farmland on the road bridge tile is clearly divided as arc of the bridge spans only above the bridge and there is no grass under the arc. On this particular tile here we have a river, correct, but the arcs are wider and span also over the grassland. So the farms are NOT divided by the bridge. You can get from the upper part to the lower by just walking on grass - you need not go on water. Whereas on the road bridge tile you must use the road to get from one farm to the other. Understand?

At first glance it may appear as if the farm continues under the bridge, and perhaps it does, but for all practical purposes there are four separate farms.

Tema 468: Playing with 3 rivers
Pregunta:
I am getting a second "The river II" for free. I am thinking in playing with the 3 rivers, I`d like to do it this way:

1 Spring
2 Branches
1 lake
2 lakes ending in the city.

What do you guys think? Suggestions..............

Respuesta 1:
Why not?
I am already playing with both Rivers (I and II). I keep all the tiles but the Source in a small bag from players will draw and play until the river has been closed. At which point we grab the large bag with the non-river tiles.

Works fine.

Respuesta 2:
Seems reasonable. We play with two springs (R1 & R2) as follows:

1.) Both springs go back to back, and block farms (so they're both facing in the opposite directions).
2.) Set aside two of the lakes (keep one lake and the branch in the bag).
3.) Everyone draws tiles, placing them where desired, but not in a way that will make finishing the river impossible.
4.) Once the branch has come out, add one lake to the mix.
5.) Stick the last lake on after the last tile has come out.

We also make it so that the volcano and blank lake don't count as a turn (we don't have the dragon yet, so the volcano might as well be the blank lake), but the lake with the city does count, since you could place a meepl on it.

Why not?
I am already playing with both Rivers (I and II). I keep all the tiles but the Source in a small bag from players will draw and play until the river has been closed. At which point we grab the large bag with the non-river tiles.

Works fine.
Same here, works really well and the size of the river always change so it makes a different setup everytime.

Respuesta 4:
whoa! i play with river I and II, and i already think it's a big river!
I imagine using 3 or more rivers... and 3 full carcassone sets? that must give a huge table filled with tiles in the end-game.

I start wih river I and II, and then use the basic tiles and all the 4 main expansions (the dragon and towers together create big havoc, so lot's of fun and tactics)



Tema 469: River U-Turns
Pregunta:
The river cannot u-turn at all at any time.

Respuesta 1:
I remember reading an FAQ somewhere that said it just stopped "immediate" U-turns.

However, we've always played "no u-turns of any sort" and can't being ourselves to adjust

Respuesta 3:
I've read that series of posts previously. The rules state: "a river tile may not be placed so that the river makes a "U" turn." I've played hundreds of Carc games and I have never had an issue with this.

Respuesta 4:
It's quite simple if you just remember that the spirit of the rule is that you should not place a river tile in such a way that it will ever become impossible to continue the river.

I am in complete agreement. I guess I never played with people that would place a tile in such manner as to cause eventual placement issues.

Respuesta 6:
IIRC, you may place right-straight-right in the official computer game. The only thing forbidden is an immediate u-turn.

Respuesta 7:
Quote:
U-turns for traffic are usually defined by an "immediate 180" while a "right, straight, right" is "two 90 degree turns", or "two right turns", not "a U-turn".
Personally, I don't think that the rule is vague at all. In regards to your traffic example, I often drive on divided highways. So, in essence if I were to U-turn on a divided highway, I would turn left, drive straight for a bit, and then turn left again. This is still a U-turn. The traffic example you give also leaves much to be desired by definition (what is immediate?).

The rules explicitly state no U-turns, so my take is that regardless of how many intervening pieces there are, you can't bend the river back on itself.

That is my take on it, too.

I don't see why people want rivers bending back on themselves, anyway. If they want to minimize the spread of the river, why play with it at all? I want the river to flow right down the middle of my map.

Respuesta 9:
Quote:
IOW, your take is that no matter how long the block, turning right and turning right again is a U-turn even if it puts you on a different road?

Or that going West in New York, then South to Virginia, then East to the shore is a U-turn?

By that logic wouldn't circling the block be no turn at all?
By definition (taken from Webster.com), a u-turn is "a turn resembling the letter U". So, yes, your example would be an example of a u-turn (albeit on a large scale). You could have a "right" turn of the river and then several straight river tiles between, the next river turn tile you placed would have to be placed as a "left" turn. You could not do a "right" turn because that would bend the river back on itself, which is illegal.

Circling the block would be a circle and not a u-turn. Of course you could think of it is multiple u-turns, one after another.

Respuesta 10:
You're circle comment also gave me an idea. A circle is a circle. So if I drive south from Ohio to Tennessee, then east from Tennesse to Virginia, North from Virginia to Pennsylvania, and then Pennsylvania back to Ohio, I have completed a circle (regardless of scale). Similarly, a u-turn is a u-turn (regardless of what preconceived notions you have placed on how "large" a u-turn is allowed to be).



Tema 470: Linking Farms to Cities
Pregunta:
How is a farm linked to or cut off from a city?

Ex A: Some roads have a narrow strip of land between the road and the city (parallel to the city). If there is any green space that connects to the next tile, do you keep connecting the farm to the next tile?

Ex. B: Does the cloister tile stop a farm, or do you just follow the green space around it to the next tile? (My wargamer background want to count the whole cloister tile as "blocking terrain.")

All of the rules examples use just two or three tiles, so its hard to get an idea how to score the "whole Carc."

Thanks.
-Mike Windsor

Respuesta 1:
Any green continues from tile to tile, so in your examples bith tiles link farms and continue them.

The only exception to the rule is the teeny, tiny strip of grass on that city tile (in one of the expansion packs) that has a tunnel running under it.


N.

Respuesta 2:
As I play the game, the field around a monastry is just meadow and the influence of the farmer goes on to al the 4 rectangular bordering tiles. In all exemples, meadows arde defined as bordered by citywalls or roads, so where they are not there, cows and pigs are roaming on. Only of a road leads to a citygate, the meadow is blocked.

This implies that cloisters are valuable tiles if you reckon on the pionts of your farmers.



Tema 471: Scored farm...3 points or 4?
Pregunta:
I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my brain around the Carc ultimate rules PDF. I THINK it lists a plain old one meeple farm (sans pig) counts 3 points per completed regular city. Is this correct? My copy of the rules says 4 points. Apparently, the rules for farms have had some sort of overhaul. Is this the overhaul in question?

Or is it something else (maybe 3 points with expansions, 4 without)?

Respuesta 1:
My understanding is that the base game's rules were overhauled: later editions list each scored farm as three points instead of the four that the early editions specified.

My own edition says four and we like it that way: our battles over farmland are intense and the source of most of the game's interest. I suppose the rule change makes roads and such more valuable and therefore balances the game a bit better; but we like our farmer wars and have not tried the rule change.

Respuesta 2:
It wasn't just the points that were overhauled. They changed the way the farms were scored to simplify it:

Old:

You check each city, and the player who has the majority of farmers supplying it scores 4 points.

New:

You check each farm, and the player who has the majority scores 3 points per city in that farm.

Along with the new rules, they also changed "2-tile" cities to be worth 4 points, instead of the 2 points stated in the original rules.

However, Rio Grande decided not to change their rules and left them as per the originals.

The new rules work better when you have the expansions, particularly the Traders and Builders (with pig)


N.

Respuesta 3:
Three different scoring rules were in place during the years (having tried them all, we now use the newest one).


Original
Each completed city is fed by the player with more farmers supporting it via adjacent fields. Value: 4 pts.
Besides, cities made by only two tiles are worth 2 pts instead of 4.

Old
Each field is won by the player with more farmers in it. Value: 4 pts per completed city touching that field.
Besides, cities made by only two tiles are worth 2 pts instead of 4.

New
Each field is won by the player with more farmers in it. Value: 3 pts per completed city touching that field.
The exception about cities made by only two tiles is no more (they are worth 4 pts as you'd expect).

You forgot the most important difference between old and new: Each city is scored once. So if you had the majority on two adjacent fields to a city, you got the points for this city only once. Now, in the latest rules, you get the points for one city multiple times if you have the majority on more than one adjacent field.

Right, but I thought it was implicit in how I worded my sentences.
The original scoring about farmers had the completed CITIES awarding the points (to whoever had more farmers on the fiels surrouning the city).
The new scoring about farmers has the FIELDS awarding the points (how many points depends by the number of completed cities surrounding that field).
Overall, the new rules are more "intuitive": they consider the field as the area to score (like cities, but with value depending on adjacent features rather than size).

Yes, that's the difference between 1st edition (original) and 3rd edition (new).
But the main difference between 2nd edition (old) and 3rd edition (new) is:
In both cases, you scored FIELDS. But in the 2nd edition (old) rules, even if you had the mojority in two fields adjacent to one city, you only got the points for this city once.

So can someone provide the link to these ultimate new rules? I haven't played Carcassonne in a while and last I played it was farmer numbers which indicated who scored a land area, scoring based on the number of completed cities on the land. Four points per completed city on your land...cities could be scored more than once. 2 points per dinky city when completed but ehy scored four points for farmer scoring.

I'd always played the 3 point *NEW* rules, up until last month when I played a game at Beyond Monopoly: York! and some guy insisted on using the old scoring, backing it up by waving the copy of the RGG English rules at us.

I came 2nd, only 3 points behind the leader who hadn't done ANY farming, so I would have won using the new rules (since I got nothing for my farmers)... the player who insisted on the old rules came 3rd, but would have been much further behind otherwise.

Respuesta 11:
I wanted to stay with the 1st edition rules since Rio Grande has refused to budge on the matter. But with each new expansion, it just got harder to keep straight. We finally switched to 3rd edition and it is much easier.

To me, it makes the most sense. Farmers farm, so look at the farm. Determine ownership of the field (farm) and remove any one who loses out because they lost the majority. Then count all the completed cities that touch that field. When you are done counting, take the majority farmers off the table. You can now see clearly what fields still need to be scored and repeat the process.

The 1st edition just got to confusing. Look at the city, then try to determine how many different fields touched that city, whil keeping track of majorities. And then go to the next city. So you never knew if you missed a city, never knew if you counted all the remote and strangely connected fields. And most importantly, it was difficult to explain the concept and allow newbies to grasp it. They usually just got pissed and played cities, roads, and cloisters.

The game is supposed to be light, quick, and fun. It took a degree in spatial recognition and almost as much time to score fields as the game itself when you played the 1st edition rules. 3rd edition made it much easier to tally points and finish out the scoring so you could start the next game.

Go with 3rd edition and maybe Jay will get the hint someday to change the rules for Rio Grande (and correct the language mistakes in Princess!)

Respuesta 12:
We look at each city and give 3 VP to the color(s) with the most farmers in fields touchin the city and mark the city with an unused meeple.

I guess we are using version 1/2/3.

Respuesta 13:
Strangely enough, we misread the Rio Grande rules, and scored farms by counting the number of cities within a field, and scoring 4 points each to whichever player had the most farmers in that field. From what I can tell, its a mix of the old and the new rules.

We've talked about changing it, but since everyone in my group knows this method, and enjoys it, we decided not to change.

After all, as long as everyone is confortable with the rules and having a good time, the game is serving it's purpose.

Respuesta 14:
Blagh.
First edition rules with two points as punishment for building a cowardly little castle (sometimes worth it if nothing else is on, or to give yourself an extra four points at the end) is much better in practice than giving a whopping four. Also, the four points per castle in the farm finish makes it far more aggressive and violent with games changing on it. Often I've put men in early and my wife, with plenty of spare meeples, bombards me on all sides withmore farmers, adding them in all over the place. It's massively frustrating, anger-inducing and generally brilliant.
Therefore we play with those rules and wouldn't play the new rules any more.

While I agree in principle, it usually doesn't make such a great difference (how many "little cities" do you build more than the opponent in a game? three? that's just 6 points, usually not enough to matter. Getting rid of an exception thus streamlining rules is a better choice, so I agree with the reasoning behind the "updated" rule).

You know, that is one thing I like about having more than one rule option. It keeps everyone happy. I am a firm believer in "house rules". On the other hand, if we had a definitive set of rules we could make sure we were all playing the same game. I'm on the fence.

About the cities... I think it makes a very big difference. By the 2pt city rule, you had to play 3 little cities, to make 6 points (6 tiles), whereras you could spend 3 tiles to make 1 city for 6 points. thats a 3 tile spread. Thats a big difference.

many small cities also makes farm scoring more elevated, which is why for us, weve chosen to score 4 points per city in a farm... things balance out.

Respuesta 18:
The Original rules are better in my mind for one reason:

Farms are scored differently than cities.
The 'original' rules allows for a different kind of manipulation and decision making while placing farmers where the 'new' rules require the same tactics for farmer placement as cities.

Scoring 4 points per city in a farm only balances out when the player who scores the city is NOT the player who controls the farm.. otherwise.. in the case of a two-tile city.. the player who controls both scores 8 points.. instead of the 7 points in the 3rd edition rules of the game. (No Cathars or Pigs)
In the 1st edition rules a two-tile city only scores 2 points, so the player in your example would score 6 points in the 1st edition, or 7 in the 2nd…

Respuesta 20:
But seriously, why does this issue still cause such contention? Every single expansion (with the possible exception of the GQ mini-expansion, which hardly counts) was produced with 3rd edition scoring in mind.

Isn't it a bit like hearing a demo of a cool song and thinking the guitar solo was slightly better than in the finally released version, even if the keyboardist did fluff his part? And then the American distribution accidentally released the demo on the CD instead of the final version, but refused to correct it, even though the band kept encouraging people to listen to the other version - the one they wanted you to hear in the first place.

I know it's not quite the same, since Carcassonne was originally released with the 1st edition rules (naturally enough), but they were changed almost before anyone could blink.

Well… does anyone know whether RGG first published Carcassonne before or after it won Game of the Year? Because by the time it won, it had already changed to 2nd edition rules. Which means, if nothing else, when you play with the RGG rules, you aren't even playing the game which actually won.

The point I was making was connected with HiG anyway, whose rules should automatically take precedence over those of RGG, since HiG are the original publishers. And as far as the point about learning to play with RGG rules before coming online and finding out about the HiG rules, well that's obviously fine. I was trying to say that a lot of people end up making spurious arguments about why the 1st edition rules are 'better', even after they learn that all of the expansions were developed with other rule sets in mind. No, you don't have to change when you find out about the new rules. Once you do find out, however, then objectively speaking, it should be clear enough which rules are 'correct'. That still doesn't mean you have to play with them - there's absolutely no problem playing with the rules you've got used to. But you should at least acknowledge that the RGG rules are an anomaly. That was the point of my story about the demo song…

As far as i know, at the time Carcassonne won the SdJ, it had 1st edition scoring. 2nd edition scoring was introduced in the following print run with the SdJ logo. It was told that they had to contact the Jury to get an ok for the rule change, since you normally aren't allowed to use the logo if you change anything of the game.

I'm quite sure Rio Grande published Carcassonne before it won the SdJ, since they used the old box cover. And then they decided not to change the rules, since they didn't consider them too complicated. Little did they know of the many expansions to come.

Tema 472: King and Robber Baron
Pregunta:
Hi all... my first post here !

I've recently submitted a comment onto Matthew Harper's Carcassonne FAQ site (I'll copy & paste some here), but thought I should seek some opinions here too. There are quite a few things that have happened in our games which have caused heated discussions, so some clarification would be great..

First thing I'll deal with is probably one of the more common issues we face. Who gets the King or the Robber Baron ?

We have played with a "house" rule where if the King is currently being held by a player who had a city comprising say 5 tiles, and some other player comes along and completes another city of 5 tiles, then the King would pass to the owner of the 2nd city (and the same would go for the Robber Baron and a completed road). In other words, the player who MOST RECENTLY completes the largest city/road becomes the King/RB. This is purely to move the King/RB around between players a little more, and generally works quite well.

I believe the rules state that whoever completes the largest road or the largest city becomes the King/RB (as appropriate).

I think that this rule should be changed so that the person who SCORES (ie holds the majority) for the longest road or the largest city should become the King/RB, not the person who "completes" it.

My argument against the rule that whoever completes the town/road should receive the King/RB keeps in mind the basis/story behind the game of Carcassonne (as I understand it, anyway !). There's a reason why the Robber Baron was given that name. He is the greatest thief in all the land, and without a doubt the controller of the longest road. To think that we have someone who has built a road that is 10 tiles (miles ?) long, for example, and to have some little upstart come along, lay 1 tile (mile of road), and then claim the right to be the RB when the other 10 tiles are being patrolled by other robbers seems simply ludicrous ! The player may have added some length to the road (in fact completing it), but he certainly wasn't able to "work" it, stealing from all passers-by just as the owner of the road has been.

Precisely the same argument goes for the city and who should receive the King. To have a player come along and place one tile to complete a city of great size and then lay claim to ruling over it (and, incidentally, all the other cities in the land) seems very unfair to the Knights who put all their effort into building their great city !

Now, of course, the whole situation becomes even more complicated when the feature that is being completed is in contention by other players. A city (now the largest) is being completed, and 2 or more players hold equal stake in that city. Who becomes the King ? Since it's a draw (there's no majority), should the person who earlier completed the largest city remain King, and the new knights miss out ? That idea also seems to make little sense. Surely the King would reside in the largest city in all the land ?

We've also toyed with the idea that in the above situation where no-one holds the majority of the largest completed city/road, the King/RB should be handed back to the game scorer. In the case of the King, this could mean he's left his kingdom to spread the word about the glory of his cities ! And as for the Robber Baron.. well.. perhaps he's been forced to flee the law !

Well, that's my first issue, anyway.. Since each is probably going to be a bit of an essay describing the situation and my opinion, I'll spread things out and deal with each issue separately. I'm certainly looking forward to everyone's opinion here... I've read some great arguments in other threads !

Respuesta 1:
The point of the King and Robber Baron is similar to that of trade goods in Builders and Traders, it's to provide incentive to complete other player's structures. This helps to prevent the situation where two players are basically playing solitaire on two areas of the board (though with more aggressive players this happens less). I think the way it currently works is best as it provides more mechanism for interaction and provides less of a "win more" mechanic that your provides. If you're already scoring the largest city, you're doing pretty well in the game, getting the bonus for the King is just a "Win More" situation.

That's certainly one way of looking at it. But I would have thought they were there to reward those who are smart enough to build a large city and win the majority (ie stopping other players from building into it).... which is a long, long way from solitary play. But as it stands, Player A and Player B lock in extended battle for domination of a city, then Player C comes along and completes it, becoming the King in the process. Player A and B then momentarily go into the next room to erect gallows for the unsuspecting Player C. What happens afterwards... well, it's not pretty...

Any fool can block/end structures all day, preventing other players from getting higher-scoring structures (as incredibly frustrating as that would be for those other players), but it takes a little bit of intelligence (and luck) to battle other players for domination of a city or road.


Avri Balofsky
@Reish Galuta

Maybe, if the largest city comprises of 34 tiles and it's worth 80 points or so plus some goods to whoever dominates it, but when it's only 5 tiles and the player who holds the King is determined to hang onto it, and so he continually blocks the building of larger cities.... ARRRGGGHHHH, where's those gallows ?

I do understand what you're saying, but I can't agree. It just seems so... "counter-productive"...

Respuesta 3:
HR --

Per the official rules, the King & Robber Baron are awarded to the player who completes or closes the biggest city and road, respectively -- NOT necessarily to the player that owns each of them. Of course, it is possible that the one player both owns and closes the biggest city or road.

In order for a player to claim either King or Baron from another player, the claiming player's city or road must be larger than the existing one -- a tie means that the existing player keeps the reward.

Of course, we screwed it up the first time we played it -- awarding King & Baron to the player who owned the largest city/road, regardless of who actually completed it. We tried it the "official" way a couple of times, but have since gone back & continue to play it the "incorrect" way. The difference, although subtle, seems to help balance out the disparity between building roads only because one cannot build cities, and building roads solely because it is a viable strategy on its own.

I have a lengthy article on the Carcassonne page detailing our full set of House Rules, in regards to the many expansions we always use when we play.

Respuesta 4:
As mentioned already - the tiles goes to those who complete, not necessarily those who score it. If you want to take the tile away, you have to build bigger not the same size structure. We played the former wrong the first few games, and actually only noticed we were doing it wrong because of comments on BGG. We have always played the latter.

An argument can be made for either way. I have found through Traders and Builders that it is no wise to end your turn where someone else can close a city you are working on. I always try to leave my cities with 2 openings (of course this only really works well in a 2-player game). Then with the use of the builder in that city, you try to cap both openings on your turn instead of allowing an opponent to steal what you were trying to trade. Likewise, the King and Baron will want to do the same: attempt to keep growing their city to the desired size.

Once you have either tile, it is then in your best interest to close cities/roads as quickly as possible - 1) so that no city will challnege yours and 2) so that you can pick up extra points by having more completed structures.

Carcassonne is very agreeable to house rules so feel free to modify it how you see fit. Once you settle on one ruleset, you just develop your strategy around that. I find that the official rules work just fine and see no need to change them.



Tema 473: Stupid basic rules question
Pregunta:
I am absolutely positive that this is a dumb question, but I need to ask it anyway.
I played only my second game of Carcasonne with two of my friends last night. We used just the basic set with the little river expansion and I have a question about basic scoring that doesn't seem to be clearly answered in the rules.

If someone places a tile so that a feature which doesn't already have any followers on it completes (this happened most frequently with tiny two tile towns or roads) can he then play a follower on this now just completed feature and immediately score it?

We did this in our game, but to me (and at least to one of my two friends) it "felt" wrong, but in looking at the rules we could see nothing that actually prohibited this. I was hoping to find something about it here but I haven't so far, which leads me to be believe it's a question so foolish that no one else has ever needed to ask it.

Respuesta 1:
Yes, according to the instructions, you can add the tile which say, completes a two-tile road or castle, drop your follower on it, score your points, and take your follower right back to your personal supply.

It does feel weird - kind of makes you wonder what's the point of putting the follower on the tile just to immediately take it off. We usually announce it after a while, and kind of do a swift hand motion for visual effect only. lol

Respuesta 2:
We played without allowing this for our first several games. Then I played it on BSW and saw others doing it. (First I thought it was only in Hunters and Gatherers.) The rules aren't crystal clear and I am not sure it's not a better game without allowing it, but the common interpretation is that it's allowed.

Respuesta 3:
Actually, the rules are crystal clear about it, to the extent that they specifically point to an exception --when you complete a 2-tile city, you can place a meeple in it and take it off immediatly, but you'll only score two points. It then says that you can do the same for roads and score normally.

Respuesta 4:
Yes, this is allowed. Moreover, etiquette obligates one to clearly announce 'doink' while putting down the meeple and then picking it up again in order to signify to the others that, yes, you are aware that this is a cautious and uninteresting move, lacking in verve.

Quote:
It is possible, in one turn, to place a Follower, to score it immediately and to retrieve it. To do so, it is necessary - in this order - to:
1 Complete a pathway, tower or dwelling by placing the current tile.
2 Place a Follower (according to the rules on page 3)
3 Calculate the score for the completed area
4 Retrieve the Follower.
Carc: The Castle (two player game) allows this.

Carc: The City (the posh one with the walls) doesn't.

As long as you exhibit that you actually *have* a follower in your supply, that's fine. Sometimes people get so carried away with the 'automtic' nature of scoring-and-retrieving that they (or their opponents) don't even check that they have a meeple to place-and-retrieve. If you don't have a meeple, you can't do this.

Tema 474: Scoring of cities/roads. Once or many times?
Pregunta:
Hello!

One question, which's just klling us here.

When you score the city (or road or cloister) and return the follower, is it possible for your opponent to put his follower on your former city (road, cloister) and score??

If yes, what about you doing one and the same thing with one of your cities (roads, cloisters)??

What's the sequence then??

Please, help...

Respuesta 1:
You only score a city, road or cloister once it has been completed. therefore, your opponent can't place any more followers on to it, as they can only place followers on tiles they add to the gameboard.

Turn sequence:
Place tile - place follower - score any completed things - remove followers from completed things.

The only time you would score incomplete things is at the very end of the game, when no more followers can be placed.

Respuesta 2:
Scoring incomplete features is only possible in Carcassonne - Neues Land ('New Land'). If you refer to this game, you are right: your opponent may score it after you scored it. And even you may repeat this until a feature is closed. But in original Carcassonne, you may not, cause of the points mentioned by the posters above.



Tema 475: Which parts aren't used if you have both river expansions.
Pregunta:
I'm just starting to play Carcassone. 2 games so far using just the basic set, which came with free "River" expansion. I have all of the expansions and plan on slowly phasing them in. I was checking out the "River 2" expansion and noticed that if you put this with the first "River" expansion, there are two springs and three endpoints--one with a town section and two lakes (one regular and one with the volcano). Are you supposed to use all of these (ie, two different starting points since there are two springs) or do you just remove one of the springs and one of the lakes?

BTW, this game is AWESOME!

Respuesta 1:
There are no specific rules for combining them, but I think the rule for selecting tiles to use would go something like this:

Aldaron's Rules Summary*
wrote:

Respuesta 2:
I have always used my own rules for the river.
This variant makes the river more varied, which we like:

Use the Source as the starting tile and put the rest of the River tiules in small bag. Remove the Volcano if you don't play with the Dragon expansion.

Players draw from the bag until the River has been closed - upon which point the next player will draw from the normal tiles and the River bag is returned to the box.

This way the river may be as short as two tiles (source and end) or it can become very long.

A great variant. There are many and you should free to experiment. After all, the rivers are there to provide variety at the start of the game.

A set-up rule that works for any combination of river tiles (as specified above) from either expansion would then look something like this (ignoring mention of anything not used):

Aldaron Rules Summary
wrote:
Place the spring tile face up in the middle of the table, set one lake/end tile (with a volcano, if in use) and the branch tile aside, face up, and shuffle the remaining river expansion tiles and place them face down. (The basic starting tile is not used.)
In drawing tiles (again ignoring any tiles not used) you'd then first draw the branch tile, then face the down river expansion tiles, then the face up lake/end tile, and then tiles from the general supply.



Tema 476: All the expansions - rules questions!
Pregunta:
We tried our first game with all the expansions put together today. We had some questions - I'm looking for a good FAQ, but I thought I'd post them here, too, for a quicker response.

Is Carcassonne (Count of Carcassonne) scored as a city at the end of the game?

Does the Dragon eat followers off the tops of towers

I seem to remember a reference to a pig farm - not just the pig miniature. Are there any rules regarding a pig farm?

Do builders remain if the player's knight/thief on that feature is eaten or captured

Do builders count as followers for control? Can I remove my opponent's knight from a city and later take it as my own, even if he has his builder there?

When the builder grants a double turn, does the fairy move after the first turn, the second turn, or both turns? Does the player score a point for the fairy once or twice?

Can the Tower capture pigs or builders?

Does anyone have any good recommendations for setting up the Count of Carcassonne along with the rivers? We ended up with the river curving back, and a few impossible-to-place tiles.

The FAQ specifically states that a builder does not count as a follower for purposes of determining who scores for a city. The builder does count for purposes of scoring points with the fairy. The FAQ is a little less clear on whether an unaccompanied builder prevents placing meeples on the same feature, but my reading is that it doesn't.

My reading is that it does, on the basis that the builder is a follower, and therefore although it doesn't count towards scoring, does count towards occupation.

For example, blue has a follower in the city, and as such normal rules for building onto that city apply. Whether that follower contributes to scoring is irrelevant.

It seems to me that to say a non-scoring follower doesn't 'occupy' a city or field or whatever is to introduce new concepts into the gameplay, whereas to say that a builder is a follower and therefore 'occupies' in the usual way is the simplest explanation. Short of a ruling by HiG (or at least persuasive arguments to the contrary), that's what I'm going with.

I'm not sure. I think meeples prevent placement of other meeples (only), and, while any follower scores with the fairy, only meeples count towards determining ownership. This is all in the rules summary: the trick is mastering the "figure taxonomy":


http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/115183

This taxonomy is now out of date. It's now more like:
- "follower" == meeples, mayor, wagon
- "figure" == follower + pig, builder, barn
- "piece" = figure + count, dragon, fairy, tower

Respuesta 7:
I'm not convinced. I don't recall any point in the rules or FAQ in which HiG makes a distinction between scoring and non-scoring followers (what we're designating meeples and non-meeples) in any way other than in terms of their scoring ability. The difference between meeple and follower is, as far as I'm aware, solely for our convenience.

The crux of the argument seems to be on whether meeples make a difference for the purpose of scoring and occupation, but I have no reason for thinking that this is true - in fact, I can't even see why you might think so.

In the case of a city, only knights score. That's clear. But a city without any knights but only a builder still has a follower in it, and that should be enough to prevent any player occupying a city as if there were no follower there. And according to the Traders and Builders rules:

HiG
wrote:
Schwein und Baumeister werden behandelt wie die übrigen Gefolgsleute. Sie müssen auf die soeben gelegte Karte gesetzt werden. Kein weiterer Gefolgsmann darf dort platziert werden.
Translation:

Quote:
Pigs and builders are treated like the other followers. They must be deployed to the just-placed tile. No other follower can be deployed there.
That last sentence at least suggests to me that builders and pigs 'occupy' tiles in the same way as other followers. It certainly doesn't seem to imply that builders and pigs should be treated any differently.

If HiG wanted to make a such distinction, I'm sure they would have said so. If someone can point me to a place where HiG say 'like normal followers except in the case of occupation' then great; otherwise I don't see any cause for us to think such a thing.

It also seems relevant to point out that in The Cathars, builders can escape through cloisters (http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2006/01/can-builder-escap...), even though the rules only mention knights (ie, scoring followers). The distinction certainly isn't being made there, although it would seem a relevant place to make it; and the fact that the rules themselves only mention scoring followers (meeples) is rendered irrelevant when it comes to the FAQ, which corrects that to 'all followers'.

I think we should perhaps start compiling a new list of questions for HiG…

Pigs and builders also differ from meeples in that they don't follow the exclusivity rule when placed:
http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2005/07/are-you-allowed-t...

So, I think we agree (and the rules and FAQ clearly state) that meeples differ from other followers in that (a) only they contribute to majorities in features. But it is also true that (b) nothing blocks the placement of pigs or builders. The question (which a I said, I'm not sure of the answer to) is whether the reverse of (b) is true: do pigs and builders block the placement of meeples? I think they don't and that therefore (c) follower placement is not prevented by the presence of pigs or builders, which yields my formulation:

Aldaron's Rules Summary
wrote:
The player may not deploy a meeple on a field, city or road segment if that segment connects to a segment on another tile (no matter how far away) that already has a meeple on it.
In addition to being simple, this seems to be consistent with the nature of pigs and builders. These pieces serve simply as "bonuses", and shouldn't interfere with (as they aren't blocked by) the placement of game's basic "scoring" figures, meeples. (Think, for example about the pig herd: There's been some difficulty sorting how how to interpret it, but I think it is correct think about it as a neutral pig printed on a tile. If that's the case, then clearly, pigs can't block meeple placement.)

Think, fore example about the pig herd: There's been some difficulty sorting how how to interpret it, but I think it is correct think about it as a neutral pig printed on a tile. If that's the case, then clearly, pigs can't block meeple placement.
The pig-herd is definitely an odd tile, but since it does not involve deployment as such, I don't think it can be used as a parallel to a normal pig. The deployment of a normal pig is dependent on the prior deployment of a farmer; while the pig-herd tile is in play from the start of the game as a tile, rather than as a follower. I think that it remains a tile throughout the course of play, even if it does have certain follower-like characteristics; and as such, it's difficult to conclude much about the behaviour of pigs on the basis of the behaviour of the pig-herd tile.

More importantly, even if pigs and builders are not blocked by other followers (or meeples) of the same player, it doesn't mean that other followers will not be blocked by pigs and builders. Not being blocked by other followers is part of the 'job description' of a pig and builder; not blocking other followers is not mentioned as part of their job, and isn't logically implied by the fact that they themselves are not blocked.

I still think the problem is the use of the word 'meeple', which I still don't see as necessary in this case. It seems to me that the use of the word may be determining the characteristics of pigs and builders, rather than the other way round…

True. That's why we need a ruling from HiG on this. I can see it going either way.

Matthew Harper
@mjharper

I strongly disagree. Regardless of the outcome of this case, 'meeple' clearly refers to the characteristic people-shaped figures of the base game, which have several distinct characteristics not shared with other followers: only they count towards majorities in features, only they can be placed in or removed from Carcassonne City, only they have their placement blocked by other followers. The use of the word meeple simplifies many rules which would otherwise have to say "followers (except the builder and the pig)", or worse (esp. if new figures appear in future expansions).

...especially because the T&B rules were written before there were any ways to eliminate followers-- either the dragon, princess, or the towers. Or even the Cathars.

I guess there's no way to figure this out without an official ruling, but I still think the "builder doesn't prevent a knight from claiming a city" interpretation makes more sense. A strict reading of the (various) rules would seem to say otherwise though. Oh well... I'll keep an eye out for anything official here and on your FAQ pages.

Tema 477: Turn Order Summary with Tower Rules
Pregunta:
Here is a turn summary I use when playing. I recently updated it to fit in the tower rules. It also contains all the expansions rules except for the downloadable one.

I have found that it often answers many timing questions and helps me to visualize a structure for the game. I have left out many of the minute details in favor of simplicity and conciseness. I have it formated in MS Word to fit on a two sided sheet that fits in the box - alas the servers are not up and i can't post the file yet.

One note - I called the new tower followers "guards" and the area in which you can capture another follower the "patrol area"

Any feedback/errors/suggestions is much appreciated.


Carcassonne Player’s Turn Sequence

Step 1 – Score the Fairy & Ransom Prisoners (if applicable):
-If the Fairy is with one of your Followers (Pigs and Builders count) score 1 point.
-Once per turn you may give another player 3 of your Victory Points in order to get back one Prisoner(your choice) from them.

Step 2 – Play a Tile:
-You must draw one land tile and place it. An unplayable tile is discarded and a new one is drawn.
----If the tile completed a City with trade goods symbols you take the corresponding trade good tokens.
----If the tile completed a City larger than any previous City then you take the King.
----If the tile completed a Road longer than any previous Road then you take the Robber Baron.
----If the tile is played on a feature with your Builder you will receive another turn after this one (even if your Builder is subsequently removed).

Step 3 – Tile Actions:
-If playing a Standard tile (no Princess, Portal or Volcano on the tile) you may…
----Place a Knight in an unoccupied City segment on this tile or…
----Place a Thief on an unoccupied Road segment on this tile or…
----Place a Farmer in an unoccupied Farm on this tile or…
----Place a Monk on an unoccupied Cloister on this tile or…
----Place a Pig in a Farm section on this tile if one of your Farmers is already in the connecting Farm or…
----Place a Builder on this Road segment if one of your Thieves is already on the connecting Road or…
----Place a Builder in a City segment on this tile if one of your Knights is already on a connected City segment or…
----Place a Tower piece on any Tower tile or any unblocked existing Tower piece and you may then take one Prisoner from the patrol area (except another Guard) or…
----Place a Guard on top of any existing Tower thereby blocking it from building higher or…
----Place the Fairy on any tile that already has one of your Followers.
-If playing a Portal tile you may…
----Place a Knight in an unoccupied and uncompleted City segment on this or a previously played tile or…
----Place a Thief on an unoccupied and uncompleted Road segment on this or a previously played tile or…
----Place a Farmer in an unoccupied Farm on this or a previously played tile or…
----Place a Monk in an unoccupied and uncompleted Cloister on this or a previously played tile or…
----Place a Pig in a Farm on this or a previously played tile if one of your Farmers is already in the Farm or...
----Place a Builder on a Road segment on this or a previously played tile if one of your Thieves is already on the connecting Road or…
----Place a Builder in a City segment on this or a previously played tile if one of your Knights is already in the connecting City or…
----Place the Fairy on any tile that already has one of your Followers.
-If playing a Princess tile…
----On an occupied City then you must remove one Knight or Builder (large Knights are removed last).
----On an unoccupied City then play it as a standard Tile (see above).
-If playing a Volcano tile then you must place the Dragon on the just played tile.

Step 4 – Move the Dragon & Prisoner Exchange (if applicable):
-If you captured a Prisoner in Step 3 from any opponent who has a Prisoner of yours then you must swap the Prisoners (players choose which one to get back).
-If the tile placed in Step 2 had a Dragon symbol, then the Dragon is moved 6 tiles now.
----Starting with you and in play order, the Dragon must be moved 1 space so long as there is a legal move.
----The Dragon can not enter a Carcassonne City tile, the tile with the Fairy or any tile it previously moved to this turn.
----It eats any Follower on the tiles it moves to (including Tower Guards)– return them to their owners.

Step 5 – Score Completed Areas (if applicable):
If the tile played in Step 3 completed any Cities, Roads or Cloisters then start the scoring process.
-Completed Road
----Players can (once each) in clockwise order move 1 or more of their Followers from the Blacksmith in Carcassonne City to this road if they are not blocked by the Count.
----Determine Majority (large Followers count as 2, Builders and Pigs do not count).
----The player(s) with majority scores 1 point for each road tile (2 points per tile if one or more Inn is on the road).
----If the Fairy is on a tile of the completed Road then the player who has a Thief on that tile scores 3 points.
-Completed City
----Players can (once each) in clockwise order move 1 or more of their Followers from the Castle in Carcassonne City to this city if they are not blocked by the Count.
----Determine Majority (large Followers count as 2, Builders and Pigs do not count).
----The player(s) with majority scores 2 points for each city tile (3 points if one or more Cathedrals are in the city)
----The player(s) with majority scores 2 additional point for each shield in the city.
----If the Fairy is on a tile of the completed City then the player who has a Knight in that tile scores 3 points.
-Completed Cloister
----Players can (once each) in clockwise order move 1 or more of their Followers from the Cathedral in Carcassonne City to this Cloister if they are not blocked by the Count.
----Determine Majority (large Followers count as 2, Builders and Pigs do not count).
----The player(s) with majority scores 9 points for the Cloister.
----If the Fairy is on the Cloister tile and the player has a Monk in the Cloister they score 3 points.

Step 6 – Carcassonne City (if applicable):
-If you have earned points for an opponent in Step #5 but received none yourself then you may place one Follower onto the Blacksmith, Cathedral, or Castle spots in Carcassonne City and may optionally move the Count to one of these spots.

Step 7 – Return Followers (if applicable):
-All Followers in scored areas are returned to their owner's supply.
-If you received another turn due to the Builder in Step 2 then take another turn starting with Step 1.

Carcassonne Final Scoring

Step 1 – Score Uncompleted Roads, Cities and Cloisters
-Prior to scoring an uncompleted feature, players can (once each) in clockwise order move 1 or more of their Followers from the appropriate spot in Carcassonne City to the feature if they are not blocked by the Count.
-Determine Majority for each feature (large Followers count as 2, Builders and Pigs do not count).
-The player(s) with majority score features as follows:
----1 point for each Road tile in an uncompleted Road (0 points per tile if one or more Inn is on the road).
----1 point for each City tile and Shield in an uncompleted City (0 points if a Cathedral is present in the city).
----1 Point for each Cloister tile plus 1 point for each of the surrounding 8 tiles.
----3 points if the Fairy is present with your Follower in a scored incomplete feature.

Step 2 – Score Farms
-Prior to scoring a Farm, players can (once each) in clockwise order move 1 or more of their Followers from the Market in Carcassonne City to the Farm if they are not blocked by the Count.
-For each Farm, determine majority (large Followers count as 2, Builders and Pigs do not count).
-The player(s) with majority in a Farm score 3 points for each completed City bordering the Farm (4 points if your Pig or the pig farm tile is present in the Farm – 5 for both)

Step 3 – Score King, Robber Baron & Trade Good Tokens
-The player(s) with the most Wine tokens scores 10 points.
-The player(s) with the most Cloth tokens scores 10 points.
-The player(s) with the most Grain tokens scores 10 points.
-The player with the King scores 1 point for each completed City on the board.
-The player with the Robber Baron scores 1 point for each completed Road on the board.

You might want to rewrite "Step 7". Returning followers isn't really a distinct step, and the last part should read:

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for the feedback Roy!

I wasn't even aware there were official steps to Carcassonne - heck I just broke the game down into what seemed logical breaks for me to better handle timing issues and such.

I figured at some point the followers needed to be returned so I just put a logical last step in to do this since nothing can really be done after followers are returned and to define when during the game this needs to happen.

I guess I left out the Volcano tile on purpose. I should have mentioned that my summary is for a standard turn (i.e steps/actions that could happen on any turn of the game not just a specific times). I personally view the river stuff as more a part of the setup (since it only happens at the start of the game) then regular game play and if I ever get around to printing up a setup summary would include it there.

You are right though that the best way to handle it would be to add an "If you played a river tile" section to Step 2 with river placement rules (no U-turns, etc) and the volcano go-again trigger, etc - something to mull over.

At this point the summary barely fits on 7x10 card at 10pt font so adding anything is a tricky situation lol.

Of course my summary is nowhere near as comprehensive as yours and is probably a bit too much for reading during a game as it is.

I was more trying to break the game down into logical steps based on a scattering of existing rules than to make a compliation of all those rules for resolving rule issues.

But at least you haven't pointed out any blatant mistakes which I was sure I made a few of.

THanks again for your always expert Carcassonne advice.

1. Help me understand this, but do you score 3 points for that city no matter how large or small it is or do you score the normal points for the city plus 3 additional points for having a fairy paired with your meeple.
You score the city as normal but then get 3 bonus points for the fairy and knight sharing a tile at the time of scoring.

Quote:
2. If the fairy is on your builder or pig, do you still get the 3 points?
Before, this was legit. Now the Big Boxs rules have over turned this. A fairy only scores bonus points when it is on the same tile as a follower. A follower is now defined as only the regular meeple and the large meeple. The builder and pig are no longer followers. And in addition to not scoring bonus points, you shouldn't be moving the fairy to a tile with the pig or builder either.

Quote:
3. If you and your opponent are tied for city or road, but you own the fairy does the 3 points only apply to you or your opponent also?
I am not sure what you are asking. Being "tied" in cities and roads shouldn't have anything to do with it. In addition, no one owns the fairy - even if you just moved it.

However, if through the Count or the Magic portal, you end up having meeples on two different features of the same tile, and the fairy is there, and both features are completed at the same time, then you would both get the 3 points (you for the city +3 bonus and your opponent for the road +3 bonus).

In Carcassonne, the person with the most "influence" (most meeples) get all the points. If two or more people tie, they all get the maxmimum points - there are no distribution of points or tie-breakers.

Respuesta 6:
Ah. I see what your are saying now. I think I got close with my 2nd paragraph.

First off, it is somewhat rare to be on the same tile. Since tile placement is the only time you place a meeple, you will never put 2 meeples on the same tile. The exception to this is the Princess & Dragon, and the Count of Carcassonne expansions. In P&D, you have the 6 magic portals so there are 6 opportunities there for a meeple to be on the same tile yet a different feature. With The Count - you then have the opportunities for multiple meeples to be on the same tile and the same feature as it is being scored (but this shouldn't effect the fairy and scoring - I think).

I am not sure what context mharper used "owned" but I think it is misleading in this case. If you do not place a meeple, builder, or pig at the end of your turn, you have the right to place the fairy wherever it is allowed to be placed. But the fairy is always a neutral piece.

So if red used a magic portal and took the road portion of a tile that blue already had a city knight, and then blue placed the fairy on that tile, both red and blue would receive the benefits of the fairy on that tile. At the beginning of the red's next turn, if the fairy was still there, red would score a bonus point. Then if ti was still there during blue's turn, he would receive a bonus point. If the dragon was moved, it avoids the entire tile that the fiary is on, so both red and blue would be safe. Red could not be picked off because blue was the one that placed the fairy. If the city closed and scored, blue would get the points for the city as normal plus the bonus points for the fairy sitting there. Blue would be removed but the fairy stays put. If the fairy still is on the tile when the road is closed, red would get the bonus points along with the normal road points. I think that covers all the situations in P&D.

Now with The Count, meeples are placed once a feature is completed and just before it is scored. I have to admit, I am not sure if the situation would come up where the fairy would be on the same spot as the feature being scored. You should never have a situation where the 1 point bonus for the start of the turn or the protection from the dragon happens because both of these situation occur in different phases of the turn. You might have a situation where the fairy is on the same tile that all the dignitaries form the City are coming to to take advantage of the scoring (though I think it highly unlikely this would occure). For the sake of argument though, let's say it happens.

In this case, the fairy is on the tile of a feature just completed. Before it is scored, everyone in the appropriate quarter moves their meeple to the feature. Majority is determined and the one with the most meeples gets the points for the city as normal. But the 3 points from the fairy goes to every meeple on the same tile. There is no distinction on majority; the fairy scoring is not tied into the city scoring; if you are next to the fairy when the feature scores, you get your 3 bonus points.

What you have to remember is that the fairy is completely seperate from feature scoring. It is not like the pig where one person scores 3 per city for farms while the owner of the pig scores 4 each. The fiary is always neutral and helps all meeples - she is colorblind. And since she is a neutral color, no one can claim they own her; trying to remember who placed her last is an unnecessary complication to the game and just isn't applicable.



Tema 478: cathedral?
Pregunta:
I played this game recently in Austria, where the owner of the game had a new tile - the "Cathedral."

I've only ever played the base game before, not even the River or anything.

The tile was an all-city tile with a cathedral. I know about the all-city tiles with the shields in the upper right hand corner, those were in there as well, the cathedral was something different.

The game owner claimed that by completing a city in which there was a cathedral, the city's value tripled. We changed this to doubled when we realized that someone would be getting 60 points for one city they completed (making 40 points instead).

Even with "whole city doubled," this tile seemed ridiculously overbalanced. Nothing else even matters, completing a city with one of these will win every time.

The rule had to be wrong. What is the correct rule?

Respuesta 1:
The Cathedral comes in the Inns and Cathedrals expansion. And your friend was incorrect.

The Cathedral makes a completed city worth 3 pts per tile and shield instead of 2 - so the score does not triple, or even double. The multiplier is 1.5 - further, if the city doesn't get completed by the end of the game it scores nothing.

-MMM

Respuesta 2:
Matthew
@Octavian
The multiplier is 1.5
It's better to think of the effect of Cathedrals as adding 1 to the value of tiles and pennants in completed cities, the opposite of the Cathar (which subtracts 1).

Are you sure he didn't have the complete Inns and cathedrals set? It also contains tiles with a small lake next to roads, having sort of the same effect on roads as the cathedral on cities (2 pts instead of one, nothing if it's not finished). There are also 2 cathedral tiles (I think...), and the 'Big Bubba' meeples comes with this set.

Personally i think Inns and catherals is the best expansion. It adds more fun things without messing around too much with the basic rules.

Respuesta 6:
Ah, ok. Yeah, her set must've included inns and cathedrals without giving any indication on the box whatsoever. She thought it was the basic game.

And yeah, if it's 3 points per tile instead of 2, that's a lot less powerful. I found the thing about getting 0 points in the city if incomplete, that is much better than the way we played. We doubled all the city tiles AFTER giving them their completed score (i.e. each city tile was worth 6 points, shield tiles worth 12!).

I've always thought farming needed to be more powerful, because in most games it requires you devoting 2-3 farmers to it, which has a nice balance to it. With cities, you rarely put more than one meeple into a city, and to get a number of points far beyond the farming that my 2-3 farming meeples were gaining seemed ridiculous. This brings the balance back much better.

I found the lakes almost entirely useless. Most roads never get too long, you're usually doubling 2 or 3 points.

Tema 480: Question about double turn with the Traders & Builders exp.
Pregunta:
I'm asking here because hardly nobody visits the Traders & Builders forum.

Situation:
When you have a Builder on a city and you add a tile to this city, you get to play another tile since you have the builder on that city you just added a tile to.

Questions:
1. If you have the fairy (from Princess & Dragons), do you get an extra point. In other words, does the builder give you another *turn* or the right to play another *tile* only?

2. Same situation. Do double turns stack when you add the new tile to the city where the Buidler is?
Example. You place a city tile on a city where your builder sits. You get an extra turn/tile. You pick another city tile, that you place on the city where your builder sits... do you keep picking tiles as long as you can add to the city (or road) where your Buidler is?

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
Don't know about the fairy question, but the builder's extra tile is just a once per turn thing. So even if you place the extra tile on the builder's city, your turn ends.

1. If you have the fairy (from Princess & Dragons), do you get an extra point. In other words, does the builder give you another *turn* or the right to play another *tile* only?
The fairy only scores once. The builder actually triggers a nearly complete "double" turn, after the first is complete, beginning with the tile draw step. This turn is in all respects identical to a normal turn except that it omits (a) the fairy bonus step at the beginning and (b) the step where you check for yet another builder-triggered (or volcano/lake triggered) double turn at the end.

Respuesta 1:
OK, time for me to add my 2 cents. (?) Before this becomes final, may I make the suggestion add the Tower rules, whatever they might be? (I can't wait to get my hands on it)

I do have one slight issue, and that is with color coding the rules. First, my primary printer is a Black and White printer, and as such, all the color coding is lost. Second, my father in law is red/green colorblind, and as such, even if I did print this, the color-coding would be literally worthless to him.

To counteract these problems, I would make the suggestion of footnotes after each expansion specific rule. They could take the shape of numbered notes (more traditional), or lettered notes (possibly quicker to understand). If lettered, they might take the following shape: (R1, T&B, K&S, Co, DK/Ca, P&D, R2, To) Both would require a legend either at the top or bottom, but might be worth it, for the sake of clarity.

While I'm on the subject of expansions, might I suggest that you color code/footnote the Traders & Builders and King expansions, as to do otherwise might imply that they are required components to the game (despite your disclaimer in "Select Expansions")

Further, in the scoring chart, I would suggest breaking up at least the Road, probably the City, and possibly even the field scoring. The way you have it laid out, it would clarify the road scoring without any vertical space cost, the City at a cost of two lines, and field at a cost of three lines. That would remove the need for the special column, possibly clarifying even further.

Lastly, great work! I look forward to when you consider it a final release copy, and I think it is a great help to have all rules in one place. The work on the content of this document is awesome, and looks great, I only have a few minor suggestions with the formatting. Please consider all of this constructive criticism, and as an attempt to help, not one to hinder or discourage.

Good point. Even for those who have the necessary equipment (digital or biological) color is usually confusing. My plan (as I note in the introduction) is to get rid of the color in the final version. I experimented with footnotes in an earlier draft, but these proved distracting.

This is a very good suggestion. The current format is inherited from a version where vertical space was at a premium (my single page summaries) but here that's not such an issue. I will probably follow your suggestion.

Respuesta 5:
I think the River rule is too complex and open to arguments "A river tile may only be placed adjacent to another river tile if it extends the river from that tile. A tile may not be placed if it could prevent any subsequently drawn river tiles from meeting this requirement."

Your rule requires too much knowledge of what tiles remain in the pile, and anyway contradict the prinicples that Carcassonne allows a play which makes an unfillable hole, and also allows for picking up a tile which cannot be played (it is removed from play and a new tile taken).

The end (or ends in River II) are required to be played, so the rule only needs to ensure their playability; however the rest of the unplayed river tile don't matter. If any, or even a lot, of them need to be discarded then they just need to be discarded.

I would suggest a simple rule, consistent with the existing rules:
"Each river tile must be placed so that it would still be possible to play whichever river ends are in play if they were the next tiles."

Respuesta 8:

@johnthesweeney

Yes. I've gone back and forth on this one. My goal was to capture all the rules relating to either river expansion alone, or both (or parts of both) combined, along with the official HiG FAQ, including their "official house rules" -- but that may be more than 2 sentences can manage.

Respuesta 9:
Re "Duplication". Yes I agree entirely. My "Sequence of Play" is not intended to cover all the rules, it is intended to clarify just the sequence of play. I initially tried doing the scoring in the type of table you used, but found that the number of footnotes and brackets started to make it incomprehensible - hence the new layout of the scoring summary on my Web site. I find it easier to use and it is hopefully more flexible for whatever they come up with in the future!

Yes, it is a good thing to have both approaches :-)

Respuesta 10:
Hi again.

I found time to look through your very useful rule summary. Here are a few points:

1) You say "Fields are limited by city walls, roads and rivers"; you might want to add "regardless of whether it looks like it might be possible to walk under a city bridge or a road bridge." as there are some confusing tiles (e.g. the city bridge over the river in River II).

2) You say that I can't use a "magic gate" to get to the tile where the dragon is? Why not? If it is a nearly complete monastery then I might want to risk it. The rules say I can go anywhere that is incomplete. Why change them? The rules says that the dragon only eats followers who are on the tiles she moves to so, it might be a good play - I would be safe for the next dragon movement as well since she can't come back to that tile straight away!

3) Escape from a Cathar city and deploy straight into Carcassonne City on the same turn? I don't think that is reasonable. I know they both state that they are at "the end of the turn". But in general in Carcassonne you can't immediately re-use a meeple that was in play on that turn. I think the escape should happen last.

Hope that helps,
John

Respuesta 11:
Re 3) above - then again if you are eaten by a dragon or seduced by a princess you would be able to deploy straight to Carcassonne City. How confusing!

There are a lot of places I could add clarifications like this to anticipate things people might think, but I've tired to adopt a concise (almost legalistic) format. It's a matter of personal taste, I know, but always find "clarifications" like that confusing (what about other exceptions that I can imagine but aren't mentioned in clarifications?). The basic statement says all that needs to be said: a road is a road and a city is a city.

You're right though: there are some tiles that seem to confuse people, and I've added an illustrated appendix that explains these to the draft of the next version.

John Sweeney
@johnthesweeney
2) You say that I can't use a "magic gate" to get to the tile where the dragon is? Why not?

John Sweeney
@johnthesweeney
3) Escape from a Cathar city and deploy straight into Carcassonne City on the same turn? I don't think that is reasonable. [...] then again [...]
As you see, it could go either way. I chose this order largely fro the reasons you cite in your second post. And, note again that I indicate in the summary that this order is assumed, and could easily be the other way, so one is free to try another one, in the absence of a ruling from HiG.

Tema 483: Which scenario is correct?
Pregunta:
1st Scenario:

I place a tile that completes MY city and immediately score. I get my meeple back. Can I still place a meeple on the tile I just placed, since I've yet to place a meeple?

2nd Scenario:

I place a tile that completes ANOTHER players city and they immediately score. They get their meeple back. Can I still place a meeple on the tile I just placed, since I've yet to place a meeple?


Can I ALWAYS place a meeple on a tile just placed?
Or can I only place a meeple in scenario 2?
Or can I never place a meeple after ANYBODY is scored?

Respuesta 1:
As I undestand it the sequence of play is as follows
1) place a tile (compulsory)
2) place a meeple (optional)
3) Score any features completed by action 1.

This solves your problem. If 2 and 3 are reversed then you couldn't complete a feature and score it on that turn, which is explicitly alloed by the rules: if you had scoring both before and after meeple placing you could complete someone's feature and so remove their meeple, and then place your meeple in that very feature and score for it, clearly not the designer's intent!

I'm not looking to score on the same city that was just scored. I'm simply looking to place a farmer on the tile that was just placed that scored for either myself or another player.

Respuesta 3:
What makes you think you can't place the farmer? I mean, assuming another meeple isn't already in the farm and you have a meeple to place. That happens in step 2 just like I said. Before scoring, so if you have used all your meeples, you are stuck for that turn's placement.

Respuesta 4:
Quote:
Can I ALWAYS place a meeple on a tile just placed?


- Yes, assuming there is a legal spot to place your meeple, and you have a meeple available. The second bit is important - if you start that turn with no free meeples (they are all already placed) than you cannot place one until your next turn.

Quote:
Or can I only place a meeple in scenario 2?
- Whether you, an opponent, or nobody scores makes no difference in meeple placement. Keep in mind though, you place your meeple PRIOR to scoring. You can't place a meeple that you just removed from a completed area, you have to use a different one from your unused stock.

Quote:
Or can I never place a meeple after ANYBODY is scored?


- See above.

The reason for my confusion is that I also have Carcassone the city. In those rules they give what seems to be a different scenario when placing meeples after scoring. (if its out of order it cannot be done)I was wondering if the regular version of Carcassone was meant to play the same way as the city version and I simply overlooked this rule.

@Philip Thomas
What makes you think you can't place the farmer? I mean, assuming another meeple isn't already in the farm and you have a meeple to place. That happens in step 2 just like I said. Before scoring, so if you have used all your meeples, you are stuck for that turn's placement.
The rules say you IMMEDIATELY score a feature when a tile is placed if that feature is completed. Therefore if I placed a tile that completed someones elses city, I've reached the 3rd part of a turn (scoring) and therefore I cannot place a meeple because it is now out of order.

By "immediately," the rules mean "on that turn" as opposed to "at the end of the game." The example in the rules of placing meeples specifically shows that the procedure is:

1. Place a tile
2. Optionally place a meeple (if you have one available and not every feature on the tile you just placed has already been claimed)
3. Score any completed features
4. Return meeples from scored features to their owners

Completing a city, whether or not someone has claimed it, does not make you skip part 2 of the turn. You can place a meeple in an unclaimed section of the tile.

A good question, and an understandable source of confusion. The rules are in fact different: in The City, you can't place a meeple on a just-completed feature; in all other Carcassonne games, you can.

I believe not. If the tile U place has a volcano on it (so the dragon will fly straight to it), U cannot place a follower on that tile during your turn (or any other, actually, that I'm aware of.. eg using the Magic Portals).

Of course the tile may still be used to complete the feature, as U described in your scenarios, and the player who owns the majority of that feature will score.

So will they score the feature BEFORE the movement of the dragon?
This is another pick your poison ruling.

I beleive in both editions of the game (RGG and HiG) before the Big Box rules, the Dragon moved first. Moving the dragon was a temporary pause in the game to resolve the dragon. Placing a dragon on the volcano really didn't impact the scoring one way or another since he just moves and no meeple is allowed on the volcano tile when it is placed anyway. But when you moved the dragon, he could eat meeples before they were scored and so the dragon did impact scoring in this manner.

With the new Big Box rules, I believe HiG still retained the rule that the Dragon moves first possibly eating meeples before their completed features score.

RGG, however, went the opposite direction and rules completed featues are scored first, then the dragon moves. To me, that takes the teeth out of the dragon piece and now he just becomes a decoration on the board instead of a something to be feared.

If you finish one of your, or one of the opponent castle, you can place a farmer on that tile, as long as it's not in the castle own by your opponent.

Tema 484: Correspondence with HiG, part 2
Pregunta:
As I said in the earlier thread (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/93042), I had a few more questions for HiG, and I've just received the answers. There's a couple of surprises in there too:

HiG
wrote:
1) Question: Can followers be deployed to the fields, cities and roads on the outer tiles of the City of Carcassonne via a magic gate?
Ansswer: No, that would just cause trouble. Would they then be protected from the dragon, or could the dragon indeed move onto the fields and only rampage outside the city? But the dragon empties the whole field.

2) Question: Can the fairy be moved to the outer tiles of the City of Carcassonne?
Answer: It follows from 1) that it can't.

3) Question: Does you receive the bonus from the the pig-herd tile even if you don't have a pig on the field?
Answer: Yes, the pig herd is a neutral pig, so to speak.

4) Question: When using the princess tile to remove an opponent, can you still move the fairy to one of your own tiles?
Answer: No, for the same reason as with volcanos.

5) Question: When a player is forced to place a tile on a city occupied by another player, and therefore cannot deploy a follower, can they still move the fairy? Or is it the same as being forced not to deploy a follower when placing a volcano tile?
Answer: In this case he may move the fairy, since the volcano rule does not apply here.
1) is a bit odd, as I would have thought it was possible. A bit of reverse logic going on there, I think. You can't use the magic gate to move a follower to the fields surrounding Carcassonne because the dragon can't go there - odd.

3) is interesting: there's a thread (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/72924) where we debated precisely this and concluded that the bonus of the pig herd was dependent on having a pig too. Oh well.

Well that's a pretty geeky rule. But it reminds me of a story.

Back in the early 80's a friend of mine was hitching across the Southern U.S. He's got a rucksack with the union jack hanging off the back and he's on a long straight desert-type road and nothing in sight. Then behind him he hears a big truck gunning up the road. As it passes him the brakes jam on and this huge rig squeals to a stop. The driver is an old boy and tells him to jump in.

The driver explains that he wasn't going to stop until he saw the flag;

"Hell boy, I haven't seen one of them flags since double-u, double-u two. So tell me........what part of Germany you from?"



Tema 485: Running out of meeples
Pregunta:
What do you do when you run out of meeples? We've just gotten our game(3 players) and most of the meeples went on the board as farmers. What do you when you place a tile and have no meeple to use to stake a claim?

Respuesta 1:
You score any completed features, and your turn ends. (See rules below.)

Respuesta 2:
Note that you don't have to place a meeple every turn, either.

Respuesta 3:
To be slightly less opaque: you need to manage your meeples, as they are a limited commodity. Placing a meeple as a farmer means you will never get to play that meeple again, and should you lock all your meeples in as farmers you never get to play meeples again.

So you always want to save some meeples for scoring in a way that will return the meeple to your supply.

Respuesta 4:
So, when I play a tile, do I have to place a meeple??? The only other time I played this game(which was my first time) was at Christmas time and on 2 other players were familiar with the game.

Respuesta 5:

@sbszine
Note that you don't have to place a meeple every turn, either.

Respuesta 6:
You do NOT have to place a meeple everytime you place a tile. Indeed, many times you will not place a meeple on your just played tile.

The meeples are a limited commodity. The Knights, Robbers, and Priests (I think those are the correct names) are reusable through out the game. The Farmers go on the board and are not used for the rest of the game.

Farmers are a double edged sword. On one hand they can net you a lot of points, but they only score once...at the end of the game. Part of the strategy in Carcassonne is managing the balance between points gained verse meeple use.

I try and get a couple meeples involved in longer term (big point) projects like cities and lucrative Farmers. I balance those longer term meeples with a couple medium term churches, and roads. Then I keep the last couple for raiding and really short term high turnover projects.

If you are all placing Farmers are you sure you are remembering that you cannot place a meeple in direct opposition to any other meeple, even your own?

Peace

Respuesta 7:
The complete rules to Carcassonne are:

Setup: Place the start tile in the middle of the table and place all other tiles in a bag or face down within reach.

Play in a series of turns, drawing tiles blindly (from the bag/supply) until all tiles have been drawn, then proceed to final scoring (below).

Turns: Each player’s turn consists of a number of steps, in order:
(1) The player must draw one land tile and place it adjacent to at least one previously placed tile. Each feature at the edge of a tile must be continued on any adjacent tiles. (An unplayable tile is discarded and a new one is drawn.)
(2) The player may deploy one follower to the tile just placed, in a feature that does not contain any other followers.
(3) If, through the placement of the land tile, cloisters, roads or cities are completed, points (see table) are awarded to the player(s) with the most followers on each scored feature. All pieces in scored features are returned to their owners’ hands.

Final scoring: After completion of the turn in which the last tile is drawn, the game ends and all features with followers are scored; points (see table) are awarded to the player(s) with the most followers on each scored feature. (Followers can be removed as points are awarded.)

Scorning Feature: Turn / Final
Road - Per tile: 1 / 1
City - Per tile; per pennant: 2 / 1
Cloister - Per surrounding tile; for cloister tile: 1 / 1
Field - Per completed city bordering: - / 3

If you like.

Keep in mind too that the expansions assume that you are using the current rules. This has caused considerable confusion here in the past among people using the old (alternate "official") rules.


First Edition:

For each city, count the total number of farmers adjacent to the city in all adjacent fields. These farmers are said to supply the city. The player with the most farmers supplying the city earns the 4 points. It is unclear how expansions should influence scoring; players should agree amongst themselves how to do this.

(Too keep track of scoring, players may wish to consider placing a token in each scored city.)


Third Edition:

The owner(s) of each field score 3 points per completed city bordering it.

(As with all other features, you can remove followers as each field is scored.)

Respuesta 23:
Thanks for the reply. Sounds like it may be simple to comply.

In our most recent game (7th total in our lives) we scored the farms as:
(a) Find the majority holder of a field by meeples (farmers).
(b) Score the holder 4 pts for each complete city his field (farm) touches (5 w/pig).
(c) Remove the meeple(s) and pig(s) for that field.
(d) Move on to the next field and score it in the same way, taking only the meeples (and pigs) left on the board into consideration (not whether a city had already been counted for a previous farm scoring).


Does that method match any of the "real" rules in the history of the game?
And, if we change our 4 (5 w/pig) to 3 (4 w/pig) are we in compliance with the latest ruleset?

cheers!

Tema 487: Adding More Followers?
Pregunta:
I am new to Carcassonne, and I am already addicted. I have begun playing with some different expansions, so now the game has 30+ more tiles than the original game. I am wondering if we are supposed to ever add anymore regular follower meeples to the game? I realize that with different expansions you get other types of meeples like pigs, etc. Also, in the Dragon and Princess expansion where we added 30 more tiles, the dragon makes it where you regularly get meeples returned to you. I am just wondering if we are always supposed to only have the original 7 meeples or if we can have more when playing with expansions? Thanks for the help.

Respuesta 1:
Hi Katie --

Welcome to BGG & the addiction that is Carcassonne -- my wife and I suffer from the same affliction!

To answer your question, there is no "official" provision for adding more regular meeples as you add expansions -- unless you consider the Big Bubba double meeple in the Inns & Cathedrals expansion to be "regular"

This might make it seem as though you have less and less meeple to work with as you add expansions -- which is somewhat true. However, it also adds a layer of strategy, as you are forced to consider the consequences of meeple placement more carefully. I rarely commit to a situation that will leave me with no "back-up" meeples in my supply, but it *does* happen.

However, Carcassonne is one of the games that lends itself well to all sorts of House Rules -- and you could easily pick up an extra base set to add meeples, tiles, or to enact any of the myriad variants that are listed on the game's page here on BGG. While we don't do that here, there are other things we have added to make the game more balanced, as we play it -- (all players keep one tile face down, that can be played in place of drawing from the bag....use the city tiles from the Count expansion to start, but don't use the Count himself unles there are 4+ players, etc etc etc)

Point is, do what works for your game group -- and, fortunately, Carcassonne is inexpensive enough that you can try all sorts of things to get it right

Respuesta 2:
The extra tiles, to me, suggest cutting back on the number of tiles rather than adding more meeples.

That is, mix the whole set of tiles together, then pull out 72 tiles (the number of tiles in the original game) at random, face down, and just play with those (more or less to taste, of course).

Assuming complexity of any given tile (and corresponding rule) is equal to any other, the primary effect of adding tiles is to lengthen the game (by that many more tile draws). It only secondarily affects meeple placement (by, for example, delaying the point in the game at which you start placing farmers).

Respuesta 3:
I definitely like the game how it is. Committing to a farmer placement with more tiles availible is a slightly bigger risk but the thieves and knights are constantly recycled as you complete features.

Respuesta 4:
Here's what Hans-im-Glück had to say about the idea of using more followers:

HiG
wrote:
We definitely do not recommend using more followers to simplify the game. The shortage of followers is intentionally built into the game, in order to increase the motivation to play. From a pedagogical point of view, the effects of wastage are made clear in the game. In our experience, leaving this element out only serves to make the game boring.
Of course, they say that it is not recommended, rather than not allowed, and it's up to you how you play. We normally play with all the expansions (which clocks in at 186 tiles, 114 more than the original) and find that the basic seven + the übermeeple/Big Bubba works fine. You just have to pace yourself, and, like the others have said, go easy on farmers in the early stages of the game.

The HiG quote is take from my website of translations of FAQ at http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/

Tema 488: Correspondence with HiG, Jan 2006
Pregunta:
Aldaron (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/Aldaron) asked me to help go through his Carcassonne Rules Summary to make sure it was as comprehensive as possible and took account of all the FAQ which are available. As we went through we found that there were still a large number of areas which were ambiguous or contested, so a list of questions was compiled and sent off to HiG for official rulings. The questions (and answers) are translated below - anyone who wants to check the German should visit my website (http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2006/01/correspondence-03...), where the original is listed alongside the individual entry.

Some of it is fairly pedantic stuff, but some has also come up in threads on BGG. There's also one or two surprises!

There's another (shorter) list being prepared; I'll post those too when they come back. And the summary will be along soon too, I should think!

HiG
wrote:
1) When The River and The River II are combined, should we make two rivers (using the two springs) or discard one spring and one lake and make just one river?
Answer: One spring and one lake are discarded.

2) If a player has the fairy on the same tile as a pig or builder, do they still receive the 1-point bonus at the start of their turn?
Answer: Yes, both are followers. (Can also be eaten by the dragon, etc.)

3) If a player has a double turn because of a builder, can the 1-point bonus from the fairy be added on both occasions?
Answer: No, the builder makes ONE double turn, not two single turns. So points are only awarded once.

4) In the question about the princess and the big follower, it was said that the big follower is not removed by the princess, but remains until there are no more knights in the city. Does he still count in that case?
Answer: Eh? Count towards what? The big follower should only be removed last in order to limit the loss to the affected player. That's the whole content of the passage.

5) If a builder is stranded when their player's knights in the city are eaten by the dragon or removed by the princess, does the player still receive a 3-point bonus from the fairy when the city is completed and the fairy is stood on the same tile as the builder? The same question goes for the pig.
Answer: The same as question 2: yes.

6) Does the city of Carcassonne count when calculating the number of cities adjacent to a farm during final scoring?
Answer: Yes.

7) The dragon may not be able to enter the city of Carcassonne - but can it move onto the outer tiles? Can it fly about the outside of the city in order to reach a normal tile?
Answer: In order to avoid the consequences described, that must also be forbidden. The dragon clears out the whole tile and doesn't distinguish between city, farm… that''s also valid for Carcassonne.

8) Can pigs and builders use the magic gate?
Answer: Like question 2.

9) Can you move the fairy if you had no followers, pigs or builders left, and were so unable to deploy one?
Answer: Yes.

10) Does the spring tile end a farm? Or does the farm go right around the spring (there's only one farm on the tile)?
Answer: Officially, the farm goes around the spring. So it is a connected farm. I personally prefer to use it as a division, since otherwise, despite the river, there is still only one large farm.

11) Can a builder escape from a besieged city via a cloister?
Answer: Like question 2.

12) If a player has no followers available but is eligible to move one to the city of Carcassonne (because, for example, he completed the city of another player), can he allow a knight to escape a besieged city and then move the same follower to the city? (order: escape then city, or the other way around?)
Answer: Moving players to Carcassonne takes place after scoring, so always at the very end.

13) When a player receives a double turn, is the second tile drawn and played before the first one is scored? Or does the second turn occur after the first turn has been completely finished?
Answer: After scoring.

14) With the U-turn rule when building rivers, does that mean no U-turn ever, or just no immediate U-turns, because it will complicate the placement of subsequent river tiles?
Answer: Only immediate U-turns are explicitly forbidden. (Naturally there can also be problems if a straight is in between.)

15) Since a player is allowed to deploy a followers when placing the river tiles, can the fairy be moved when they do not deploy a follower at this stage?
Answer: Yes.

Suppose a river (black dice) comes in, turns right, straight, turns right, straight... then with the next player to play at '2', draws a turn. If he playes it ti turn right, rather than left, then if the next player draws another straight, there's a problem.

The problem is easily avoided (the player playing at '2' can't play another right turn). But it is possible that, if players are freely allowed to play however they want provided they don't do an immediate u turn... they could get into this situation. The player at 2, strictly speaking, isn't making an illegal placement. But it may leave the next player drawing a tile he can't legally place.

No problem. Your point is a very good one. The strict HiG answer fails to confront it, and their parenthetical acknowledgment (or is it dismissal?) of the problem doesn't really help much.

Respuesta 7:
Ah, while it's fresh on my mind and I'm feeling especially geeky...

Consider two scenarios:

(in my diagrams, a black '4' is the source, a black '1' is an already-placed river tile, and the black '2' is the position of the next river-to-be-placed.

1.








In this case, if 2 draws a turn, can he place it to turn right (upwards, in diagram)? The next player could not have an illegal play. But if both the next player and the following player only draw straight river segments, the following player could be in a 'no legal placement' situation.

Similarly,
2.






could cause a no-legal-placement situation (if the next player draws a straight, and the following player draws either the straight-between-cities (RCRC) or the turn-opposite-city (RRCC). Neither tile would legally be able to match the field edge of the source.

Respuesta 8:
Nice black and white dice diagram.

I guess what I was overlooking was the @*ck-wit gamer who takes great delight in consciously maneouvering the set up stage of a game to deliberately break it. In my long standing gaming group, if anyone ever turned the river right at the '2' dice position they would be subject to immediate, unilateral abuse and a ride in the boot (US readers thats a trunk) of a car to be dropped off x miles away for them to consider the error of their actions during the walk home.

If you are going to allow extended 'U' turns then a run of 2 straights might still lead to the same dilema on a wider 'U' turn. The player who initiated the problem (at the '2' die) isn't breaking Aldarons revised rule but if the next player draws a straight at '3' they cannot control the situation and have broken the rule by default;








Changing the word from 'would' to 'could', perhaps extends the liability of a type '2' move but isn't this all becoming a bit legal and complex? In my experience the game is better if the river follows the PC game ruling and only flows in 2 compass point directions. This results in an extended river and a more open game rather than a cramped start.

Not only does the no 'U'turns rule (no matter how wide) improve and open up the play (IMHO), but the rule wording is simple and counters deliberate game sabotage.

Each to their own, and if people like ox-bow lakes in their games then go for it, but you better pack sensible shoes if you try to play that way around my house.

…I was overlooking was the @*ck-wit gamer who takes great delight in consciously maneouvering the set up stage of a game to deliberately break it.
What I don't get is why anyone would want to do that within the opening moments of a game. Did the gamer in question not want to play in the first place? Or is it just to prove how clever they think they are?

What HiG might have said
wrote:
Only immediate U-turns are forbidden, because they automatically lead to problems in subsequent tile placement. And although such problems can still occur when there is a straight tile or two in between the bends, surely no-one would be so obtuse as to wilfully force the said problems on their fellow gamers. Should such a person exist, then we wholly endorse their immediate defenestration.
… sorry, "defenestration" is my favourite word, couldn't resist…

Respuesta 11:
Well you are from the right part of the world to appreciate the defenestration of Prague 1618. We did that in history at school and as I remember no one was killed. Which means that a minimum storey height would need to be incorporated into the ruling to ensure serious injury or death.

Indeed no right minded gamer should ever deliberately try to derail a game. There again, no right minded gamer should ever play Risk sober. But there are those who do. Defenestrate the lot of them (3rd floor+).

Respuesta 12:
Why not allow the long U-turns and just use the standard "if a tile can't be placed legally, discard it and draw again" rule to resolve the problem (eventually drawing the lake if no other river tile can be played)?

Respuesta 13:
Even the lake might be impossible. Revisiting my first example:







Suppose the river tile at black-die-5 is one that has a city on its south edge. Suppose that the tile played at 2 is a right turn, and that all turn-with-city tiles havealready been played. There's no tile that fits there. Not even the lake.




Also, from the discussions about how much this is being nitpicky... that's the point of clear and concise rules, to place all aspects of a game beyond the realm of uncertainty, to be able to concisely state why the scenario *can't* (and not just "oughtn't") happen. Even if there's virtually no practical application, a ruleset should concisely answer any possible (even if improbable) "what if?" situation.


Besides, I could see someone seriously wanting to make this play - to forcibly enlarge his farm by causing a river to double back (in this example, if black-die-5 had a field along its south edge, the player playing to spot '2' may want to play his river tile bending right and place a farmer on its northeast corner, in expectation that the next player draws a river-turn and plays it bending left, connecting his farmer to the fields along the upper portion of the river).

That's the point of what Rulemonger was saying. There is a precise rule for such situations. It doesn't take much to extend the rule about "no legal placement" to "no placement which must lead to no legal placement". In your example, turning right a third time would result in no possible legal placement. So the awkward player has a choice: either

- voluntarily turn the tile represented by to the left, so that no problem arises;
- have the card removed and discarded by group consensus and allow play to pass to the next (more sensible) player (Rulemonger's point); or
- insist on the placement and risk forceable defenestration.

Nul problemo, dude.

Actually, I was deliberately avoiding relying that rule, for three reasons: (1) you could end up having to discard quite a few tiles (in fact, possibly all the remaining river tiles), and there aren't that many river tiles anyway (2) you could be forced discard an essential tile (like the lake) and (3) it isn't sufficient to prevent the creation of awkward loops.

Sorry, I added a fair bit to my post while you were answering it. But basically I think that the situation can still be solved amicably by pointing out the subsequent problems to the guilty player, and persuading them to change their minds and change the direction of the bend.

It's a matter of etiquette, really, and I don't think it's necessary to say anymore than your proposed summary already does. It should be clear from that what is "reasonable" and what not. And any player who ignores that is out of line.

Tema 489: Just picked up Carcassonne. Which rule variant to use?
Pregunta:
Ok, just got a copy this week and my wife and I followed the rules in the book to a T. Games have been fun and enjoyable (I need to work on the cutthroat part some more though..i'm too nice and got owned last night ). I've noticed some new rules posted here with different editions (namely farmer scoring, etc).

Do I need to incoporate these rule changes? Or are things fairly balanced as they are in the Rio Grande edition?

~Allen

Respuesta 1:
In my opinion, the best farmer scoring rules are these:

Whichever player(s) win each farm score 3 points for each completed city that touch that farm.

This makes it so there's not as much competition for central cities (from all sides), and is much easier to explain/resolve.

Respuesta 2:
It is my understanding that the farmer rules were changed in later editions to be easier to explain. My friends and family never had a problem with the original/Rio Grande edition. My advice - if you play primarily with your family and a few friends, stick with the rules you know. If you will be teaching the game a lot and/or playing on BSW, learn the newer rules (although even BSW allows you to choose the old, it's just not default)

Respuesta 3:
When playing with new people or teaching the game, I think it's important to play with the rules as they're written in whatever ruleset you have, if for no other reason than to avoid the appearance that you're just making up rules or playing it based on "how the german rules are."

To some people, saying: "In the 3rd edition German rules..." is not much different than saying: "In the version of the rules I just made up in my head..."

I personally like the latest german scoring - maybe I should print out the rule explanation and keep it with my set.

I agree. It also makes the farms complete, self-contained features that score points for those with the most pieces played, just like the other features. So these rules score big, so to speak, for consistency.

I've read some people complain that these rules aren't any easier or better. These are from people who had played with the old rules and don't see an actual improvement over the way they've learned to play.

Fair enough. If you've already learned the game by the original rules, you're not going to see an improvement and may as well stick with what you know. The new rules are great for new players who hadn't otherwise learned the rules, like me. I find the new rules very easy to learn and to teach, and I strongly favour them.

O.k., I'm in the same boat as the original questioner. (That is to say I just picked up Carcassonne, and am wondering which variant to play).

My question after having read your responses to that question, though, is this:

Do you think the 'new' rule on fields makes Carcassonne basically a game about farmers? (i.e. does the new rule make farms the most important (and should therefore be the most contested) feature in the game?)

I have yet to play either way (first game tomorrow, so this question probably won't be answered by then), but on simply reading the new 'score each city as many times as you have controlled fields' rules, it seems like that's a potentially massive wad of points for control of just ONE (albeit possibly very large) feature.

What do you all think?

-ZZ

Respuesta 11:
I use the rules in the box which is 4 points for each city that you have the most farmers in the connected fields. But this seems to slant the game heavily to farms. I won a four player game yesterday by near 100 points(145 to 61)almost all due to farms. It seems to get worse when in a two player game. The only thing I see that can help would be to use roads more defensivly but it really seems easier to just battle it out for the farms sneaking in farms every where you can especially end game. I play with the base game and inns and cathedrals and still seems like big points are in the fields i pretty much ignore citys unless i can bust my way in or if they are almost complete and I can get free points, plus what I will get for the farm at end game. Maybe I play wrong but it seems like farms are where its at.

Respuesta 12:

No, meeples, as such, don't score. Points are awarded to the players with the most followers in the field, with the big meeple counting as 2 followers for determining that majority.

Respuesta 14:
got it (i think). so for each field whoever has the most farmers in it (normal=1, big=2) gets 3 points for each completed city the field touches. then you do this for each field.

Respuesta 15:
I´ve been playing Carcassone a lot in BSW . I´just loose a game . I had many farms, but my opponent scores a lot early in the game. I decided to stick with my farms. I think Carcassonne is a fantastic game. You must chance the way you play every time . Your style depends on how many players are on table, how expansions are you playing with, the tiles you draw, and so on.

The farm rules with 3 points for every city a farm´s fied touch is great. It provides some great battles to have the majority in a field .

My question is :
1 - When you have a pennants in a city with a cathedral how much do you score when the city is closed ? 2 points per tile ? So , if you close a city with a cathedral DOest NOT matter if it has pennant or not ? Im correct ? If so, I dont think it is fair. I thought there would be a bonus for a player who closes a city with cathedral and pennants .

Pennants score the same as the tile itself - they are basically a "bonus tile" as far as scoring is concerned. A 4-tile city with 2 pennants is scored the same as a a 6-tile city.

So in a typical game, a closed city is worth 2 points per tile and 2 points per pennant. They are both worth 1 each if the city is not closed.

If that city has a cathedral, both the tiles and the pennants are worth 3 points each if closed (+1 bonus) or zero if open.

If the city has a Cathar tile, the tiles are pennants are worth 1 each if closed (-1 penalty) and zero if open.

If it has a Cathedral and Cathar and closed, the tiles are pennants are worth 2 points each (+1 bonus -1 penalty) and zero if open.



Tema 490: Tile placement
Pregunta:
Hello guys.

Need some help regarding tile placement. In the most common event of drawing a tile that fits more than one place what rule applies? Of course that field will match another field, city another city and so on. But if that tile can be placed in a place that connects three borders, e.g. field, field and city and can also be placed somewhere else that only connects 2 borders, e.g. field and city, is it mandatory to place it in the position that connects the most possible borders? Uge discussions came up in my playing party due to this issue because most of the times your scoring would benefit from placing the tile in a place where less borders connect rather than in the place where the most borders connect. The latter option usually benefits other player(s).

Thank you for your help.

Regards,

Joao Ferreira

Respuesta 1:
You may place your tile wherever you like,

Respuesta 2:
Wherever you like, as long as at least one side connects to another tile. In the extremely rare case that it's not possible to put your tile anywhere in the board, discard it and take a new one.

Respuesta 3:
You place it where you want. As long as it connects smoothly where you're laying it, there's nothing on the rulebook that forces you select a place instead of other. When the turn comes about, it's the other player's time to select to his advantage and so on.

Respuesta 4:
Thank you al for your prompt replies.

If you can lay a tile wherever you like, as long as it connects smoothly with a previous layed tile then what is the purpose of showing your tile to the rest of the players so that they can advise on the best laying position?

It's a joke. Just like the joke in the Transamerica rule that say you get some time after you draw your cards to grouse about how loosy they are. They're going to make suggestions anyway, but your free to ignore them. Note that an unplayable tile is only unplayable if everyone agrees that it is.

To give people a chance to influence your move. It gives you a chance to persuade the current player to put his tile over there where he can get into Tim's city rather than putting a farmer over here and stealing your meadow away...

Respuesta 7:
What they said- note that in variants where you have a hand of tiles this means you should show them the tile you are going to play, if only for a few seconds before playing it.

Respuesta 8:
I aggree with Mark it was meant as a joke. The rules have the word "best" in quotes. Best for who? But I have found it usefull to point out to the person placing the tile that if they play it just so they can really make it hard for another player (not me of course) to finish a city or block off a field. I'm nice that way...

Respuesta 9:
I like the rule of showing your tile before placing it as it allows for more interaction between the players in the form of negotations, not that every tile is fought and bargained for.

As for tile placement, the rules don't say anything about having to place it where it has the most "connections". You can place it where ever you have a match.



Tema 491: Road Scoring and The River
Pregunta:
After recently picking up this game with the free river expansion, I have been wondering about completing roads as they cross over the river on brides. I believe that the rules state one way roads are considered complete, and thus scored, is when they end at a "crossing". Obviously the T-junctions and crossroads are considered "crossings". However, are the bridges crossing over the river a "crossing"?

Respuesta 1:
Bridges do not end a road.

Respuesta 2:
I think that you should consider common sense: the crossings in the base game all are considered "ends" of the roads that depart from the crossing itself, but the bridges are clearly not.



Tema 492: Carc on BSW question
Pregunta:
On BSW, how is farmer scoring handled?

I am used to the English edition (4 pts/city - each city scores once). The person I was playing with explained it to me, and I thought I understood, but my score for farms was less than I thought it would be.

Thanks,

-TR

Respuesta 1:
The default option for farmer scoring on BSW is 3 points per city per field, which is somewhat simpler than trying to work out who has the most on a particular city.

So, in other words, you work out who wins each field, then score 3 points for every city adjoining that field. A city therefore can be scored for more than once, if it has more than one separate field surrounding it.

Hope this makes sense.

Respuesta 2:
By activating the option 'old' you get the 4 point per city rule.

Answer: Yes, and when an empty road, city, or cloister is completed, players with followers in the appropriate quarter of the city may be deployed and the scored immediately. As a rule, unoccupied cities, roads, cloisters do not earn very many points, and so this option in mostly useful for returning followers from the city of Carcassonne to the player's supply.

Tema 496: Scoring roads
Pregunta:
When you place a meeple, you must place it ON a feature, not just on the tile. For example, the tile with a 4-way intersection of roads has 8 features: 4 roads and 4 fields.

All roads end at intersections (3-way and 4-way).

You are not allowed to play a meeple on any feature that already has one (yours or an opponents), BUT you may join 2 or more like features into a single one resulting in multiple meeples on the same feature.

There's about 80 questions or so. I've included the original German under the translations so that it is easy enough to spot errors. And if anyone has any feedback, suggestions for improvements or corrections it would be greatly appreciated.

And as a second project I've developed a widget for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger which contains all of the German FAQ. An English version will be along as soon as I've finished translating. Yes, I know that developing a piece of software for such a specific platform is limiting my audience somewhat, but I'm a Mac user, and widgets are actually a kind of stand-alone website using HTML and Java - so no need to learn to program (although I do need to learn some JavaScipt…) Anyway, the widget is freely available to anyone who wants to use it and is able to. Again, the widget has been given the enthusiastic go-ahead by Hans-im-Glück, so there's no copyright issues. And any feedback would be doubly appreciated… More information and download from this address:

Posted answers to a list of questions on The Tower is sent HiG (read more here: http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2006/04/tower.html).
Also corrected a couple errors, and removed the 'Other Related Questions' sections. Why? Because it was taking far too much work! So now the questions about how a new expansion combines with an older one can only be found on the question page for the new expansion, and not on the older one as well. This means that some of the old expansions have hardly any questions listed, while some of the newer expansions (I'm thinking Princess and Dragon here) have more than you could shake a stick at. Mind you, if I started adding all the Tower questions to that, it would become truly unbearable. And anyway, I'm about to add a JavaScript-based search engine to the site, which will list all of the related questions, and do much more besides. So although by deleting the ORQs I've made browsing a bit more tricky for you (but saved myself a great deal of time), the search engine should allow you to find what you want with greater precison, and a good deal faster…

4 April 2006:
As promised, the search engine is now up; you can read the Help Guide here: http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2006/04/guide-to-searchin.... It should make life somewhat easier… And there's also a new set of links in the right-hand column to translations of the rules to various expansions by Robin Sussillo (and one by me). Thanks Robin! And I made numerous little tweaks here and there.

Thank you for all your hard work in putting that FAQ site together for Carcassone. NOTE to all who read this...it is an EXCELLENT RESOURCE, which I am sure my friends and I will frequently visit. However, there is one question that I could not find an answer to, and it is: Does anyone really use the "racetrack" scoring card to keep track of points? My gaming group has found that the simple paper-and-pencil method works so much better. Which leads to my second question: Is it legal to use the 8th Meeple durng normal game play, since it is not being used on the 'Score Card' that is provided in the basic game? Thanks. And again your blogsite is VERY well done...kudos & congrats.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks for the support guys!

In answer to John's questions, yes, we use the scoring board, and no, you (probably) shouldn't use the 8th meeple. It makes the game easier, and although the issue isn't directly addressed, there is a related page here: http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2005/07/more-followers.ht...

The basic gist is as follows:

You can now search the FAQ! Spent the last couple of days putting together a customised search engine of the site, which searches the questions, answers, and a list of specified keywords (as well as posting various FAQ about the Tower). I included the title of every expansion as keywords, so now you can search for, say, just the three expansions you have, and the top end of the results will only be about those. Should make finding what you want a lot easier!

The search field is on every page of the site (http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com) and there's a help guide available at http://carcassonnefaq.blogspot.com/2006/04/guide-to-searchin....

Respuesta 1:
You seem to be still using the pre-simplified farm scoring at the end; is that intentional?

Also, I'd like to suggest clarifying a point that came up in a discussion:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekforum.php3?action=viewthrea...

If you place a princess tile on a city only your followers in it, you must still remove a follower. Obviously, if you place a princess tile on a city with followers from several players, you can choose which - even your own, as you beat a hasty retreat.

Your text said this:

- If a Princess tile is placed, if the player set this tile in a city where there are already meeples in it, the player *must* choose one meeple and return it to its owner. If there are no meeples in the city, the player can place a meeple normally. You seem to be still using the pre-simplified farm scoring at the end; is that intentional?

I'd suggest something like: the player *must* choose one meeple (also his or her own). It would just clarify the point a bit.

I have not updated the farm scoring rules. The farm scoring in the document is the 'first edition' rules: for each completed city, player with most supplying farmers score 4 pts. It may be nice to include 2nd & 3rd farm scoring rules, but it may introduce confusion to the readers.

@maulei
It may be nice to include 2nd & 3rd farm scoring rules, but it may introduce confusion to the readers.
I must say I'm not convinced. I don't see how it would be confusing, when updating a compendium of rules to use the two newest expansions (one 7 months old and the other 2 months old) to include the updated farming rules which those expansions were intended to be played with. These rules have (basically) been current for over two years; I've been playing them since I started playing Carcassonne. A couple of days ago in a discussion somebody mentioned scoring 4 points per city, and 5 points for a pig, and counting fields on a city-by-city basis. (Link to discussion: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekforum.php3?action=viewthrea...) Naturally enough, I was confused at this, thinking that the rules might have been updated. So I checked on the Hans-Im-Glück website, and found that that scoring system was indeed out of date, and although these rules were available for download, they were only available for download precisely so that "interested" players could then see how they had changed.

Again, the real problem is that the newest expansions were designed to be played with the new rules; scoring farms at the end of the game using the Count of Carcassonne expansion would be a logistic nightmare if players have meeples in the city market at the end and you're using the city-by-city and 4/5 rules- you'd have to count all the fields, work out which fields fed which cities, then place meeples, then re-count all the fields to work out the final score.

Two points spring to mind here. If you're not including the new (Hans-Im-Glück) rules because Rio Grande Games haven't updated their rules yet - I live in Germany so I'm using HIG rules, and have no idea whether or not RGG have or haven't updated -then that's fine, but then you should probably make it clear that your rules are an RGG compendium, and not a HIG compendium, so that HIG players don't get confused. :: If that's not the case, then you should be clear about which rules are old, and which are contemporary (which are RGG and which HIG), so no-one gets confused.

I also wanted to take issue with your other comment:

Jonathan Wu
@maulei
…it is quite clear already…
The reason I made the suggestion in the first place was precisely that it wasn't clear and that's why I provided a link to a discussion in which the question was debated. Maybe I misunderstood the point of the compendium though: I though the aim was to produce a definitive set of rules - something that is sorely needed, judging from number of discussions here and rules clarifications on the official Carcassonne homepage. But if that wasn't the intention, fair enough. A compendium is still extremely useful.

I don't get you. We still steal fields all the time At least when somebody hasn't blocked the market square with the Count

And if the old rules still work, fair enough - I wasn't saying that they were old and therefore should be abandoned ipso facto. The new post of the compendium includes all the rules, and its now much easier to see where everyone is coming from (thanks maulei!)

Answer: Yes! It's a big advantage, but the rules allow it.
Moving the fairy first is the official rule, even if it is a seemingly huge advantage. But please note that that is Hans-Im-Glück rules, not Rio Grande, and there does seem to be some discrepancy between them. I can't confirm or disprove the Rio Grande rules, though - someone else will have to do that.

Respuesta 7:
mjharper, thanks for pointing it out.

The compendium is corrected. However, I feel quite uncomfortable about the fairy timing rule. In a two player game, the fairy cannot protect the meeples actually. When placing a dragon tile, the opponent can always skip placing a meeple and move away the fairy from mine.

Moreover, the 3 points bonus given by the fairy for a completed structure is also guarantee. That's why in the previous version of the compendium, I choose to say 'The fairy is moved at end of turn', which seems more fair and logical to me.

Respuesta 8:
That's true enough. To be honest, we'd been playing so that the Fairy can't be moved before the Dragon, because as you rightly say, it seems more logical. And we normally play in 2 (my girlfriend and I) and yes, moving the Fairy first would mean that the player who draws the Dragon card can always protect their nearest meeple. I'm not convinced I actually agree with the rule… especially in a 2-player game. On the other hand, in a 2-player game, each player should draw Dragon cards half of the time, so the effects will be balanced. But the ruling from Hans-Im-Glück does mean that the Dragon is more like a weapon than a random factor in the game.

Respuesta 9:
Jonathan,

This compendium is great. Im glad someone is doing it. But, there is one thing I noticed. Your end of the game Count rules dont completely jive with the HiG FAQ. In your rules, you go to each structure that you are scoring, one by one, and at each one begin with the person to the left of the last tile placer, who then can "parachute" their meeples in. In the FAQ, there is a one-time round-and-round phase where everyone adds their meeples to existing structures. After that, you then go through and score everything. A subtle change, but it can mean a difference. Other than that, great job. Thanks!

Lucas

BTW, here is the HiG FAQ section, courtesy of Matthew Harper:
Quote:
How does the placement at the end of the game work?

Answer: In principle very similarly to the way during the game. The 'trigger' for the end scoring is the player who played the last card and so ended the game.
Beginning with the player on the left of the 'trigger', each player places one of his/her followers from Carcassonne in an appropriate area on the board. Figures can also be placed in 'open' areas, since these will also be scored at the end of the game. This process continues until no player can take any more players out of Carcassonne. The Count still blocks the town quarter in which he is resident. Normally the player with the most followers in Carcassonne will be the one to place the last figure.

Respuesta 10:
I'm glad to see the compendium updated to include the Princess & Dragon. I haven't personally gone over it with a fine tooth comb at the moment (due mostly to the current hour) but I did notice the final Count of Carcassonne meeple placement inconsistency. My hope is that you will update this soon as well as add the new River 2 expansion rules (as seen courtesy of mjharper @ http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekforum.php3?action=viewthrea... )

Also just noticed:

Quote:
King & Scout: When a player places a card that completes the first city, the player received the King card (the first road completed yields the Scout card). Later in the game, if another player completes a larger city or road (by counting # of tiles, not road/city segments), the appropriate card passes to that player. These cards yield a bonus 1 point for each completed city/road at the end of the game.
Should be "Robber Baron" card instead of Scout card. Although King & Scout is the name of the expansion, King is for Carcassonne and Scout is for Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers.


Thanks!

Found another FAQ which might be useful for the compendium:

www.carcassonne.de
wrote:
Question: Can the big follower also be removed by placing a princess tile?

Answer: Yes, in which case it becomes a paladin amongst the knights and has to remain committed to her until there are no other followers left in the city. As such, the big follower can only be removed when there are no other followers occupying the city.
The normal followers are taken off immediately, and so may be redeployed on the next turn. But with the big meeple, the princess is doubly-dangerous, and paralyses it until the city is completed. I've been meaning to write to HiG and ask about whether the big meeple can then still be eaten by the dragon, but haven't got round to it. Anyway, this looks more like a new rule to me, and not so much a rule clarification.

Respuesta 12:
Nice find..

Respuesta 13:
I will update the compendium with the rules of River II (translated by Matt, thx)

Also, the 'Scout' card will be known as 'Robber Baron' (Thanks for telling, crasher)

There will be some minor update on 'The Count of Carcassonne' (thanks Lucas)

A bit off-topic... I've made a small expansion for Builders & Traders (6 tiles and 6 more goods chit). I will upload the files in BGG:Carcasssonne- Builders & Traders, after playtesting.

The idea is more or less the same as B&T, however, the goods are not placed inside the city, instead, they are on the field. The player who has completed the road / cloister with 'goods' icon, take the goods. Also, the player with most farmers on a field, at the end of game, gains 2 points for each goods icon inside the field.

From the Start of the Game / River II section:

Quote:
If you don't possess the relevant expansions, the inn, volcano and pig-herd tiles have no particular significance.
Since it is not linked to any paticular expansion I wouldn't see how the pig-herd tile would ever have no significance.

Also, as far as combining the River with the River II, the preffered method seems to be:

Take out the original lake and source. Start the river with the new source. Shuffle all the other river tiles except the Volcano Lake and Castle Lake into a pile. After the fork in the river is placed, shuffle in the castle lake and continue building the river.

Actually, the sentence crasher quoted is from the actual rules. Even though I translated the rules, I've only just noticed the ambiguity. The rules say:

Quote:
If you don't possess the relevant expansions, the inn, volcano and pig-herd tiles have no particular significance.

The Pig-Herd earns the farmer who owns this farm an extra one point per city. This bonus is in addition to the regular pig from the Traders and Builders expansion.
The problem is, that if you read the second sentence, it does sound as if the bonus is independent of the pig from Traders and Builders. But I guess that, given the earlier sentence, the bonus is in fact supplementary, in other words, you have to have a pig on a farm in order to have a pig-herd, which does have a certain logic to it. The German original, btw, is just as ambiguous, and I double-checked my translation before writing this post. I think we do have to conclude that, given the first sentence quoted above, that the farmer scoring is now:

i) three points for a city;
ii) four points for a city with a pig;
iii) five points for a city with a pig and a pig herd.

And, correspondingly, that the pig-herd can has no effect if you don't own the Traders and Builders expansion. The compendium is correct.

I've just corrected my translation to (hopefully) avoid anymore confusion, and would recommend altering the compendium accordingly:

Quote:
The herd of pigs tile earns the farmer who owns this farm an extra one point per city. This bonus supplements that of the regular pig from the Traders and Builders expansion.

Respuesta 16:
That seems like a HiG FAQ in the making. You should probably change your from supplements to requires or gives an extra point to the farmer w/ pig.



Tema 500: Various Rule Questions
Pregunta:
Rather than post in the various extension threads I thought I put everything in one place. My apologoies if my questions are repetitive. Most of my questions are based on my weak translation of the German rules as I bought the game while traveling.

1) It appears that when playing the Burg Fraulein (Princess) that a meeple has to be removed if present in the city, even if it is your own knight. Is this correct, it is not clear in the German rules.

2) In the rules for the Count. In order to play a meeple in Carcasonne the player cannot have scored points that turn. If when placing a tile to score for another player, I completed a feature and scored as well. Can I refuse to take the points and place a meeple in Carcassonne? The rules leave this kind of open ended in saying a player cannot have scored points. This can be taken both ways I think.

3) When placing a meeple in Carcassonne can the player also place a meeple on the tile that was placed?

4) Maybe a bit trivial but does scoring a point by having the fairy preclude the placement of a meeple in Carcassonne?

5) Just to clarify, the placing on a meeple in Carcassonne and the moving of the Count occurs last in the sequence of a players turn following the moving people out of Carcassonne for scoring, correct?

Thank you in advance for your help

Respuesta 1:
1. Yes

2. No

3. Yes but the meeple is placed on the tile first, right after placing the tile (if allowed).

4. No. The rules for the Count state that the point scoring involves the placement of a tile.

When a player places a tile that causes at least one of his opponents to score at least 1 point while the placing player scores nothing

Tema 502: Count extension - more questions on sequence of scoring
Pregunta:
With the count extension we wish to clear the sequence of events for scoring. Here is the scenario:

A player has a follower in Carcasonne on the cathedral corner. The count is in the same corner preventing this follower from being moved.

This same player now closes a cathedral of an opposition player. He therefore may place a follower in carcasonne and move the count.

Can he place a follower in carcasonne, move the count and then move his two followers to the cathedral just completed, forcing no score to the opposition an claim the nine poits for the cathedral.

I believe the semantics however say a follower may be placed in carcasonne if the player placed a tile that caused an opposing player to score (without scoring himself) According to this the sequence should be.

Place the final tile to close the cathedral.
The opposing player scores the nine points and remove his follower from the cathedral.
The player that placed the tile may now place a follower in carcasonne and move the count.
That is the end of the move. The cathedral is already scored and no followers may be moved from carcasonne for this particular "score".

No. Placing a follower and moving the count occurs at the very END of the player's turn AFTER final scoring.

And by the way, it also sounds like you are moving followers from the features to Carcassonne. Followers are placed in Carcassonne from the players' stash.

Tema 503: Count extension-moving followers to uncomplete cities at game end
Pregunta:
With the count extension, followers may be moved from the carcasonne to a city, street, farm or cathedral when the particular feature is scored.

The order of who may move a follower is rotated starting from the person immediately to the left of the person who caused the scoring. This is clear during the normal process of the game.

At the end of the game however there is confusion on the sequence of who should first move his follower from carcasonne. For farms, do we assume that the first person on the left of the person that placed the last tile is the first person to place a follower on a farm?. For uncompleted cities, roads or cathedrals, we assume that since these are now "scored" followers may be moved from carcasoone to any of these features. Again, the confusion is in which order is this done. Strictly according to the rules this should be in order starting with the first person to the left of the person who placed the tile that caused the scoring. This should be the person that placed the last tile.

We therefor assume the first person to the left of the person that placed the last tile may now move all his followers from carcasonne to the appropriate feature? (Except ofcourse those followers that the count prevent from moving).

Respuesta 1:
We play like this:

When the last tile is placed, that player FINISHES his turn including moving the count if applicable. Then, starting with the player on the left, that player places ALL of his followers from one quarter in Carcassonne to the appropriate scoring features including incomplete features. Continue until all players have placed their followers from that quarter. Repeat this procedure for the next two quarters. We score farms last. The count will still be on one quarter. This quarter never gets the followers to be placed at game end. After all followers have been placed from Carcassonne (except the quarter with the count), now do your normal end game scoring.

This method is the most fair for us. But feel free to create your own house rules that works for everyone in your group.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks Jeff,

This makes good sense and we will continue to score that way

Kind regards



Tema 504: Question: Can I place a meeple on an empty road/city of my tile if that tile closes this road/city?
Pregunta:
This is something I think I have right; however, it still feels slightly awkward, so I'd like to clarify it.

If I place a tile that completes an unfollowed road or city, and I have an available follower, do I get to immediately score that road?

By my interpretation, the answer is "yes"; due to the three distinct phases of each turn.

1. Place tile (completes city or road)
2. Place follower (on the same, now completed, city or road)
3. Score (the same city/road)

What feels awkward about this is that in phase 2 you are usually placing follower on incomplete features.

Have I missed a rule explicitly prohibiting this?

Thanks,
Steve

edit: subject changed per Bergyblond.

Respuesta 1:
You've got it right, Stephen. I think it actually says it in the rules somewhere, maybe in one of the examples.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks!

Respuesta 3:
Note that the ability to score on the same turn as completing a feature is the same for all versions of Carcassonne except The City.



Tema 505: City with a hole in it!
Pregunta:
I just got this game and love it. On our very first outing, I had a follower(meeple) on a city comprised of 4 single sides, creating a circle with a hole in the middle. I was assuming there would be a tile that would fit the center, but my wife drew it, and placed it on one of her cities instead.

As it's the only one in the basic set, I was stuck the whole game in my city with a hole in the center. according to the rules, a city may be scored complete if all the walls connect with no space. I does not say that the entire city must be complete. I thought I should score it as a complete city, but my wife wouldn't let me.(I was already ahead) Has this ever come up? Should I have scored it as a complete city?


Adam

Respuesta 1:
I think your wife was right. A city with a hole is not complete.

Respuesta 2:
The tiles for cities must have an adjacent side to be considered part of a larger city. From your description it sounded as if they only shared a corner. If this is true then you wife is correct. (BTW this is how to snipe other peoples cities and still obey the rules.) You could not score the other tiles because you meeple could not trace a continuous line to the other tiles. (i.e. he couldn't walk there from his current position) Of course you can't score tiles that aren't there and your city isn't complete if there aren't adjacent sides to connect up the walls.

I can picture a city with a hole that could create and a city and obey all the rules for attachment but if your city was anything like this (with the center tile removed):

http://boardgamegeek.com/image/70267
Then my above comment should stand because the other walls are not attached by an adjacent side.

Respuesta 3:
I'm not sure I completely understood how you placed your tiles... Did you place four of the half circle tiles leaving an empty square in the middle? The rules say: "A city is complete when the city is completely surrounded by a city wall and there are no gaps in the wall". Thus, your city is not complete! If you placed the tiles as I think then in fact there are four incomplete cities. Tiles are only connected edge to edge, not corner to corner. If you only had a meeple on one of those tiles then you total score for your "incomplete city" should be 1 (unless there's a shield on that tile which would give you another point).

Respuesta 4:
Sounds rather like you had FOUR incomplete cities, to pick nits...



Tema 506: City Question
Pregunta:
We just started to play this game, and I'm unsure about connected cities. If you check the gamebook (you can look at it online, also; it's the first file listed as Carcassonne Rules), there's an illustration on the second page that shows a 4x4 square. The upper left is all city. The upper right is city/field. The lower left is city/road. The lower right has a road running through it. Here's my question. If the upper left tile has not been played (the all city one), are the two city pieces (upper right and lower left) connected? Could there be meeples on both cities? Originally I didn't think so, but now I do. They are two individual cities without the upper left tile, correct? Thanks for your help.

Respuesta 1:
Re:City Question
mikeallenkc (#465013),

The two cities are not connected if the tile in the upper-left is missing. Meeples may be present in both of the smaller cities.

Since you can't place a meeple in a feature that already has one, joining features that each contain meeples is the only way to get multiple meeples into a single feature.

Learning to share or steal points from an unsuspecting opponent is one the necessary skills to playing the game well.



Tema 507: Help me with the pig rule...
Pregunta:
I got me the Traders end Builders extension, wich I found a good add-on to the game, but the pig positioning rules may be a bit vague. They only state that I can only put the pig in a farm where I already have farmers.

If I just consider this, I can put my pig very late in the super-farm, wich won't do much to the game because normally in a two-player game we get tied in farmers in that farm and both pigs end up in that farm.

Do you think that the rule means that I can only put the pig where ONLY I have farmers? It seems to make more sense because you would have to risk for it. How do you play it?

Respuesta 1:
Re:Help me with the pig rule...
rrrr (#449991),

We play that you simply have to have farmers there. The presence or absence of other farmers has no bearing on it. If you don't win the farm, your pig doesn't get anyone anything.

The presence of the pig seems to encourage people not to just build one super-farm, because then you know it will be a race to get a pig in there, or it'll become a pig standoff.

Respuesta 2:
Re:Help me with the pig rule...
rrrr (#449991),

Like any other piece, you may only play the pig on the tile you place. You may not play one tile and then place the pig on another tile. Like the builder, if your tile extends a field where you already have a farmer then you may place your pig on that tile. If your tile extends a field where you don't have a farmer, then you may not place your pig.

Respuesta 3:
Re:Help me with the pig rule...
clearclaw (#450126),

that I understand, but if there's a super-farm where two or more players have the same number of farmers (and therefore a good idea to get the pig there) it's just very easy to get the pig in that farm because you don't have to worry about other farmers, just any tile with a field that fits will do the job.

No.

Turn sequence: 1. Draw and place tile. 2. Place a meeple (optional). 3. If a structure has been completed, score it and remove any applicable meeples.

You're implying a step 4 that doesn't exist.

In other words, if you don't have a meeple in stock when your turn begins, you won't be placing one that turn.

Tema 509: need help on Carcassonne rules...
Pregunta:
I got me recently a Carcassonne game. I think it's the original version and I'm enjoying it very much.

now I've played a few games, I've come up with a few questions I hope you can answer:

I already found out in some FAQ that those isolated buildings with a road to its door are also monasteries.
What I don't know yet is, if they have a road I supose I have to match the road with another tile on that side, right?
And if I have to do that, I would think that a monastery with no roads could only connect to a green tile side, but there are examples in the instructions that show a road leading to a monastery with no road to the door.
Is this correct? If it is, does it finish tat road segment?

And if one farm is everywhere I can get without leaving the green fields, the monasteries lead almost always to one huge farm that serves almost every city. Is it so? If it is, then I guess it's normal to have this regular fight over who has the most farmers on that farm, right?

Hope you can help a beggining Carcassonne fan.

Re:need help on Carcassonne rules...
rrrr (#87063),

All road/city/farm edges must match on adjacent tiles. There are 4 cloisters (monasteries) with no roads and 2 with a road.

They do tend to make larger farm areas. If you don't want to get involved in large farm battles, you can always intentionally break up farm using various road types, or play tiles that create impossible to complete areas. You can also avoid building small cities so as to decrease the value of farmers.

Cloisters with no road can also end roads or do they only match with fields with no roads?

Respuesta 4:

rrrr (#87359),

The edge of each tile must match. So, in order to end a road, it would have to be a cloister with a road segment. A road segment could not be placed next to a field segment. Subsequently, roads will either always end at buildings or if they complete a circle.

I too was confused by the tiles showed in the rulebook (I own Devir version, which has the same examples that yours), until I realized they were misprints. In the written part of the examples, they always count the solitary cloister as a 'road+cloister' tile (for counting road tiles, for example).

The problem is that there are three different official scoring systems for the farmers. I score using the method that each completed city scores four points to the player with the most farmers in adjacent fields. Therefore, by my reckoning:

Green: 4
Yellow: 36 (unless the city at the top of the photo is complete, in which case yellow scores 40)

Your mileage may vary depending upon the scoring rules you follow.

One can horn in on an opponent's city (or road or farm) by playing on a completely unconnected tile. Then, by placing tiles to connect to your opponent's city, you can gain access to the city. This can be done with multiple meeples to wrest control away from an opponent as well. However, as you state, a meeple could not be placed on the tile that actually connects the city.

First of all, it was our first game so, I'm quite new to Carcassonne please, bare with me...Ok, My wife was making one big city where she had placed a meeple on it already. The city was closed on one side with field but opened on all three other sides (most of the tiles were of the kind which the city covers three sides of the tile). So, on one end of the city, I placed this tile which is mostly field with two city opening on two sides...like two quarter moon (one up and one to the right as an example)...So one part of it was touching the city but the other one touched nothing so, I put a meeple on it(on the city which was touching nothing), hoping that some new tile would make it join the big city later. But then, those two quarter moon part of cities are touching slightly by the corner so, my wife thought that I didn't have the right to do this but I thought I could since those two quarter moon city could actually make up two cities depending of the new tiles that would come later...Do you understand what I mean?

In all cases it isn't the meeples who score, it's the majority of meeples that determine which player scores. So a five section road will score you five points, regardless of how many meeples you have on it. Same for any other feature.

Tema 516: Question: Do you score points if you don't have the most meeples on a field/city/road?

Yep... We had a 4 person game last night that had a single field. Two players had two farmers in that field, one player had one farmer in that field, and one player had no farmers in that field.

We are using the 3rd edition German (not Rio Grande) rules, because I have the limited edition version. The interpretation we settled on was the player with one farmer was culled and the two which tied with two farmers both scored the full value of the fields.

However, it seems to me that the player with one farmer in that field should score also (at half the rate of the other scorers) because they've dedicated resources/competed for that field more than the player with no farmer there.

Re:New Farmer Scoring

That sounds like 1st and 2nd edition scoring. Is there a 4th edition scoring system now?

As far as I remember:

1st edition: For each city, count total number of farmers in all adjacent fields to determing the winner(s)... the winner(s) score 4 points.

2nd edition: Start by culling the farmers in each field to determine the winner(s) of that field. Then, for each city, any player who has won an adjacent field scores 3 points.

3rd edition: As in second edition, cull. The for each field, the winner(s) of that field score 3 points for each adjacent city. You can score a city multiple times under this rule, because you score based on the fields (not the cities like 1st or 2nd ed).

Respuesta 3:

A couple questions:

2. I understand there are some other rules differences among the editions; specifically, the scoring of a two-tile city completion (2 points versus 4). What edition rules follow what scoring mechanism here?

Respuesta 5:
Re:New Farmer Scoring
In the german rules, it is stated that the pig increases the points from 3 to 4. Sounds like they don't think someone still uses 1st edition scoring (we do).

The 4 points for a two-tile city are 3rd edition only. 1st and 2nd score 2 points.

Respuesta 6:
Re:New Farmer Scoring
thatmarkguy (#51187),

1) The pig was introduced after 2nd edition, so farms were 3 points a city at that point... as mentioned it's defined as 3 to 4 in the German rules, and the Rio Grande version (the bastion of 1st edition) says 4 to 5.

2) As already stated, that happened in 3rd edition... which, as you can see from the change to farmer scoring, was trying to simplify the game.

Respuesta 7:
Re:New Farmer Scoring
bwross (#51179),

Okay just to clarify further, under 2nd edition, is this the proper procedure:

1) Point to a completed city.
2) Look at each farm that is adjacent to that city
3) The player with the majority of farmers in each of those adjacent farms scores 3 points (4 for pig), or (3 x number of farms).
4) Move to next City.

Or is it:
1) Point to a completed city.
2) Look at each farm that is adjacent to that city
3) Any player with a majority of farmers in any farm adjacent to the city scores 3 points total(4 for pig), regardless of how many farms he/she has majority in.
4) Move to next City.

This is all very confusing.

Respuesta 8:
Re:New Farmer Scoring
There have three different rules for farmer scoring in the game. The situation is complicated by the fact that Rio Grande decided to stick with the first set and didn't make uses of any of the changes. The various rules are:

German 1st Ed and Rio Grande:
1) Look at each city
2) total up all the farmers for each player in all the
fields adjcent to that city.
3) the player(s) with the most farmers scores 4 points
for that city.

German 2nd Ed:
1) look at each city
2) if a player has the most farmers in any one of the
fields adjcent to the city he scores 3 points.

German 3rd Ed:
1) look at each field
2) the player(s) with the most farmers in that field
scores 3 points for each city adjcent to that field.

In both the second and third version of the rules is helps to remove loosing farmers in each field before scoring. You cannot do that with the first version.

The pig rule is simple and applies to all versions: if you have the most farmers in the field where your pig is, then any city that scores for you with help from that field scores an extra 1 point.

There has also been a change to the rule about 2 tile
cities: in the German 3rd edition two tile cities score 4 points upon completion instead of 2 points as in all the ealier editions.

Re:more builder questions..
incagirl (#50128),

Are you playing some house rules? There are no extra turns ever in the normal rules.

- draw a tile
- place it
- optionally place a knight, theif, monk, farmer
- score any completed city, road, cloister
- remove meeple(s) from scored object

The answer to your second question is yes. If there are no thieves already on the road, when you place the tile that completes it, you may place a thief, score the road, and remove the thief in the same turn. In fact, you should always score unoccupied completed roads, cities, and cloisters if you have a meeple available (this would be extremely rare for a cloister).

Also note that you CANNOT do the following if you have no meeples available...

- draw a city/road tile
- place it so it completes both a city and a road
- score the city
- remove your knight
* place it on the road
* score the completed road

The last 2 actions do not follow the turn order in the rules. If you have a meeple available, you could do it this way...

- draw a city/road tile
- place it so it completes both a city and a road
- place a thief on the completed road
- score the city AND the road
- remove your knight and your thief

Incagirl seems to be playing with the Traders & Builders expansion, which indeed allows extra turns.

However, as far as I know (and I haven't played with builders), you don't get an extra turn on the turn you place the builder. However, on the next turn you do get an extra turn, if you continue the road with the builder.

You can get one extra turn each round.

And as you won't get an extra turn on the turn you place the builder, there's no point placing one on the turn you complete something.

I hope that answers the questions. I recommend asking questions about expansions in the expansion entry.

Sooo, does this mean, if you place a builder on the road, you get a second turn. then, the next time around, if you extend the road, you get ANOTHER second turn? Another words, can you keep taking second turns everytime as long as it is adding to the road? (or city). .

You don't get a second turn when you play the builder.

Any time you play a tile that extends a road/city that has your builder, you may take another turn. However, you may only take one 'bonus' turn per go-around-the-table. In theory, you could wind up getting twice as many turns as the other players. But you can't take 3 or 4 or more turns in-a-row with nobody acting in between; the most turns you can get in a row is 2 (your normal one, plus one bonus one if you extend your builder's road/city with your normal turn).

Re:Question about Builders

Yes to the above. An easy way to think of it is that to use a builder, you have to follow this sequence:

Turn 1) Place City/road tile and place a "Meeple" on it.
Turn 2) Place adjoining city or road and place the Builder on the adjoining section.
Turn 3) Place a City or road tile to add to the existing city or road with the Meeple and Builder on it
**** Bonus Turn 3) Pick another tile and place it as normal (placing Meeple, scoring, etc.)

Regardless of whether you added to the City/road with the Meeple and builder on it in the Bonus turn, you do not get another bonus turn.

Turn 4 or later) Place another City or road tile adding to the existing city or road with the Meeple and Builder on it.
**** Bonus Turn 4+) Pick another tile and place it as normal (placing Meeple, scoring, etc.)

Even if the piece that you place completes the city or road with the Builder on it, you can still take a bonus turn (unless you've already taken one that turn).

An unplayable tile is to be discarded according to the rules. As Octavian said it very rare. We've only ever had it occur once and it was a four-city edge tile early on in the game where the two existing cities already had adjacent meadows thus it couldn't be placed.

If you have have your hypothetical situation the tiles would just be discarded one by one until the bag was empty.

I'd imagine if, of the base set, the first 43 (44, counting start) tiles played were all the tiles involving city segments, and they were all placed contiguously such that all 'outer edges' were cities (no outer-edge roads or fields), then all 28 remaining tiles (none of which have any city edge) would be must-discards.

Now, is the above-stated configuration possible? I'm not sure. Is it probable? Uh, not in a million playings.

Respuesta 4:
Re:Deadlock?
rdore (#48832),


From memory, I'm pretty sure that the rules state any unusable tiles are removed from the game as they are drawn, not thrown back into the bag/pile, whatever. So, as the unusable tiles are drawn, they are discarded. That is, it is impossible to end in some "deadlock" where unusable tiles are perpetually drawn, put back in the bag/pile, and redrawn.

A meeple is the small wooden figures in each player's color. They are worth no points. Their placement ultimately decides which player scores the points for a given feature on the board.

The shield is worth two points in a completed city.

If a city is completed which consists of 5 tiles and has one shield icon on one of those tiles it is worth 12 points ((2 x 5 tiles) + (2 x 1 shield)) to whomever has the most little wooden meeples of his or her color in that city.

Re:Meeple vs Shield
Perhaps this would be a good place to discuss this. We play by the rules that came with the Rio Grande 2000 version:

Roads: 1 pt per tile
Cities: 2 pts per tile + 2 pts per shield (except 2 pts for 2 tile city)
Cloister: 9 pts

ENDGAME

Incomplete Roads: 1 pt per tile
Incomplete Cities: 1 pt per tile + 2 pt per shield
Cloister: 1 pt per tile
Farmers: 4 pts for whoever has most farmers touching each completed city

Dave my rules also state that incomplete cities and shields in incomplete cities are worth 1 point per tile or per shield occurence. It makes sense, Incomplete cities are worth half that of completed cities.

I cant believe no one added this... If the city contains a cathedral, from the first expansion (Inn's and Cathederals) the shields are worth 3 instead of the normal 2.

Unless the city is incomplete and then the whole city, with a cathedral, is worth zero.

Tema 522: Question: Can I place a farmer in a field that is connected to another field by its' corner? And are bushes road junctions?
Pregunta:
I think the rule about joining segments is slightly confusing: Say I place a tile that borders a city (along the edge) with a new little bit of field which does not join any other field (yet). Can I place a farmer in that new tiny field even if that field will of neccesity join with another (at a later stage)? ie. Do tiles "join" (for purposes of deciding whether you can play a man or not) through the corners.

Secondly, with a road segment that has some bushes where two or more roads meet - does this represent the end of a road segment for scoring purposes?

Thanks in advance,
Alain

Respuesta 1:
Re:Question about
Corners don't join. And you seem to imply that such a placement is bound to eventually join - this isn't the case. For one, the appropriate tile may never be drawn (especially if the player opposing the merger works to make it a three- or four-edge match to fill the gap - if he makes it a difficult to impossible placement to match, he's stranded his opponent's meeple in a useless field). Second, there are some tiles (in the expansions) that hook a city right to a corner (such that each edge matches field or field-road, but the city splits them as separate fields at that corner). There is one such tile in the first expansion, three in Traders and Builders, and one in King & Scout.



Bushes always denote a junction, even on those tiles where the road appears not completely obstructed.



All of those roads are junctions. None of them are through-roads.



Tema 523: Going past the edge of the table
Pregunta:
What happens when tiles reach the edge of the playing surface? Are tiles unplayable past the edge, or are the rest of the tiles supposed to be nudged over to make room?

The game must be put on hold while players utilize boards and nails to extend the playing surface accordingly.

Respuesta 2:
Re:Going past the edge of the table
randomlife (#28835),

If you don't live in a house of carpenters who can quickly extend the playing surface for you, the Carcassonne rules just state that it must be played on the table.

However the rules for Carcassonne Hunters and Gatherers actually states "The edge of the table limits the playing area. Thus, a player may not place a tile past the edge of the tbale or move the playing area to place a tile that would (my emphasis) have been past the edge of the table".

We play the Hunters and Gatherer's rule in the respect, which unfortunately would rule out the carpentry option

Respuesta 3:
Re:Going past the edge of the table
randomlife (#28835),

when we see that the tiles are near the edge of the table, we (carefully) move them all to make room: we don't like to have limits due to the shape of the table!

Respuesta 4:
Re:Going past the edge of the table
randomlife (#28835),

I personally like the rule that the playing area is limited by the table, because it adds a slight strategic element. If one of your opponents starts to build a city/road to close to the edge, you can intentionally extend their city/road to the edge of the table so they can't complete it.

Hey, games like this would make a good geeklist--Attika and Hex come to mind too.

Respuesta 6:
I'm bumping this because it's the exact subject I was going to write on. My wife and I play with the river and 3 major expansions and frequently encounter the table-edge issue. I can't imagine dealing with the chore of sliding all the tiles over to make room for new ones at the edge - that would be quite an irritating interruption to the game. We currently play with the rule that a tile must fit completely on the table to be played. Still, I don't quite like the fact that one player could exploit this by deliberately building an opponent's city out to the edge - and other tactics that, IMO, should not be in the game. After the 12 river tiles are played, we do often slide them into the center of the table if they have meandered away, sometimes rotating them even, but that's only 12 tiles.

Ditto. We do our best to start in the middle and everyone knows the edge is the edge and that's it. If you really need to close a feature and a piece hangs over, that is fine - but you have to figure out a way to support it. Sometimes a slight overlap with the previous tile. Sometimes sacrificing a meeple as a counterweight.

Respuesta 12:
play on a table cloth then you don't need a carpenter.

Respuesta 13:
We do not allow any part of a tile over the edge. If someone bumps into it, it can ruin the whole game. It doesn't change the strategy, it just makes the game safer.



Tema 524: Rules question :)
Pregunta:
In the below image, we have a question about the scoring. For the castle labeled 2, would Red be considered supporting it? Assume that the sections you can't see don't change anything, and the only potential contact with castle 2 is at the points of 1, 2, and 3.

Thanks!

Red cannot reach city 2 therefore would score no points for it. Think of fields as connecting to cities at sides - not at points.

Tema 525: The River...
Pregunta:
Just a quick query.

Do farms go 'through' the lake and the spring tiles in the river expansion? When we do play as they do it seems to create incredibly large sprawling farms...

Respuesta 1:
Re:The River...
Odinsday (#25018),

in fact so many players dislike the River for that reason.

Respuesta 2:
Re:The River...
Luke the Flaming (#25062),

So we could play it that farms can't be traced through the end tiles, I guess. It'd make sense.

Everyone I've played with likes the river expansion as it sets up the start quite nicely, giving more options early on.

Maybe that will change when I Introduce the expansions :>

Respuesta 3:
Re:The River...
It hasn't been my experience that the river opens up the field that much more than the basic set alone. After all, there are road pieces all up and down the river, and they can serve to chop the whole thing up in to several fields if they're drawn in the right order. Conversely, it's not that unusual to see one huge field develop around the original starting piece in the basic game.

In terms of the spring and lake tiles, they clearly have grass all the way around, and can have grass tiles played on three sides, so it makes sense to me that they should count as open grass.

My girlfriend always places a farmer on her first play -- the large meeple if we're playing with the Expansion -- but in our experience, river or no river, that's no guarantee of a significant advantage.

Respuesta 4:
Re:The River...
Odinsday (#25018),

I drew black lines with a sharpie from the lake and from the mountain to each corner of the piece, like a city boundary, so that the field did not wrap around those tiles.

It seems to make farming a little less attractive, and removes the "no-brainer" moves of establishing farms and cities at the ends of the river.

Respuesta 5:
Re:The River...
godard (#29085),

But I don't think anyone can play on the "Spring" tile, as it is just the starting tile and isn't placed by anyone is it? It's been a while since I've played with the river, so I don't recall the exact rules. Does the placement of the lake actually require someone's turn?

Respuesta 6:
Re:The River...
Windopaene (#29087),

No, but the player who plays that first tile that connects to the spring can place their farmer on some grass that connects to the the 'wraparound field' on the spring.

Respuesta 7:
Re:The River...
I agree with the person above who found that the roads with the river always do a good job of breaking up gigantic farms surrounding the river. I always place that farms can bend around the spring, or lake.

When playing with the river compared to without, I haven't noticed any difference in large expansive farms occurring...in fact, if I had to take one side or the other, I'd say the river, more often than not, helps break up large farms...but that's just my experience....

Respuesta 8:
The River and Farmers
Wait... I'm confused. So can a farmer draw a line to a city through the spring and lake tiles or no? Is there a "official" ruling on this?

Thanks!
