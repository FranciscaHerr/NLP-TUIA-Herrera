There are a couple of tiles that are entirely city.
I think they only in expansions.

Respuesta 5:
Base game has at least one tile that is all city maybe even two tiles.

Respuesta 6:
The tile list for my base game shows 1 tile that is completely city, all four sides.

Respuesta 7:
Yes, one full city tile in the base game. See the image gallery; row A, column 3 in the pic below:

Respuesta 8:
Correct, base game has 1 cccc tile and 1 rrrr tile.

Respuesta 9:
(Also, while this particular hole is possible to fill, that won't be true of every possible hole, and that's ok. Indeed, it can be strategically important)



Tema 2: Are monasteries too powerful?
Pregunta:
I just finished playing my first game of this absolute classic, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoy Cascadia and often utilize it as my go-to game for easing people into the hobby, (before throwing Brass Birmingham at them). I assumed that Carcassonne would be a less interesting version of Cascadia since it is a pioneer, opening the gate to uncharted territory at the time of its release while Cascadia has had the chance to draw from 20 years of tile laying systems that have been designed since then, but much to my surprise, I do prefer its grandfather, (at least at this point).

After our first game, however, my whole group agreed that the monasteries seemed to be too powerful. Passing on an opportunity to place a meeple on a monastery wouldn’t have crossed any of our minds. I was fortunate enough to have access to the majority of the monasteries, while one person in our group didn’t have access to any. I won the game, and the person who didn’t come across any monasteries lost by a long shot.

Could be a coincidence. We’re all new to the game so we don’t exactly have a deep understanding of the nuances of the game and a refined strategy yet, but I was wondering if anyone else found the monasteries imbalanced? Are we simply lacking core strategies at this point?

I would appreciate any input. Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
Maybe don't let players complete monasteries? Because they require so many tiles they are pretty easy to shut down by making them difficult to complete. It's not like a city which you can just cap off if other players get too aggressive.

Respuesta 2:
Monasteries are nice, but they have two downsides:

1) Everyone could/should avoid helping you complete them by building away from them, leaving you to do the work and with a follower tied up for a while,

2) Experienced players know the number of tiles of certain types and how to leave unfillable holes (this is more common with just the base game). That can strand your follower where you could have otherwise scored it, replaced it, scored it again, and so on.

Respuesta 3:
That's the one solution that I contemplated, (aside from trying a game with monasteries removed altogether). I guess that I assumed that it would be easy to do the work yourself, (by building your own city or road), but haven't actually tried to do it yet, so it was just an assumption. I'll definitely try your suggestion before trying a game without the monasteries! I'm sure the game designer and developers considered this and I hate to remove an aspect of any game out of an assumption that I know better than the designer.

Thanks!

Respuesta 4:
Thank you! The second tip is especially helpful and makes me want to play the game again and try to familiarize myself with what's available.
I was lucky enough to find the game at Goodwill for $5, so I don't have any expansions yet and should be able to familiarize myself with what's in the box.

In the nicest way, yes you're new and lacking core strategies at this stage.

I've played a lot of Carcassonne and whilst I'm no expert I'm aware of the core strategies. I am also a recent enough convert to modern boardgaming that I remember my first plays in the hobby. Carcassonne was one of the very first, Christmas 2019, and I thought that monasteries were "the best tiles" too. I didn't know terms like "unbalanced" or "overpowered" at the time.

In my opinion, it is true to say that Carcassonne tends to be more aggressively strategic with 2 players, more subtly strategic at 3 or 4 and is close to just being a pastime at 5 or more because of the increased role of luck. Almost always at 2 or 3 and usually at 4 skill will be victorious over luck.

So to monasteries. As you discover more about the game on your personal journey and particularly when playing with 2 or 3 you'll discover more and more reasons not to place a meeple on a monastery when you draw one. There are usually more profitable ways to earn points, better places to put your meeples and more devious things to do with that monastery tile.

Enjoy the journey!

Respuesta 6:
I'm glad to hear that I'm lacking in core strategies, because I like the game and want to like it more, but I dislike whenever games have narrow decision spaces but promise depth and strategy, (like when games give you a plethora of options, but only one option is really of any use. Technically, you have a broad decision space, but the obvious choice inhibits clever gameplay).
I will be mostly playing this game at the 2/3 player count, so I'm glad that it mitigates luck a bit
Thank you for your input!

Respuesta 7:
Monasteries positively suck in the solo game!

Respuesta 8:
I’m no expert, and I honestly only recently realized you could put regular meeples on monasteries!!!

This being said, contrary to the Abbott, I believe you can’t remove them unless you have completely surrounded it; this is a big caveat.

As someone else said, it might be a mistake to use regular meeple for this, unless they’re already almost complete when you lay them.

Maybe it’s less of an issue with the base game only, but if you’re like me, you’ll soon add an expansion or two, sometimes simply to have more tiles. At that point, s will be needed to claim fields or to play a more « risky » game of trying to encroach on other people’s cities.

Respuesta 9:
Monastery give as much points as a road (1 point per tile), but it take longer before you get your meeple back. They are not too powerful, especially when you get experienced and know how to block a monastery from being completed, which basically reduce your opponent meeple total by 1.

Respuesta 10:
Though to prevent the pendulum swinging too far in the other direction: It's not like monasteries are completely useless. They have one advantage over roads in that they often have more points "locked in" at the moment they are build. Because of this, gauging which player would currently benefit most from a potential monastery draw can be important in trying to decide if you should pre-build or sabotage these nicely nested monastery spots.
General tip to quickly learn more about the breadth of strategy available: For a game or two, for each tile you draw, try to find a way to use it's grass geometry rather than the more prominent features. Doesn't mean you always have to play the grass, but try to specifically look for what these could be used for, as they are often overlooked by beginners (resulting in complaints of "only drawing roads"). Once you take the farms into considerations, you will quickly find yourself foregoing even reasonably well-nested cloister placements.

It’s not the deepest game, but oh boy, just wait… your group will realize how friggin’ mean it can be and it’s like a whole new game. No more building a pretty countryside; it’ll be cut-throat from the start.

Respuesta 12:
The simple math is that a completed monastery gives 9 points for 9 tiles. A city of the same size gives at least 18, but probably even more. A road theoretically gives the same amount of points, but I can complete it faster and, depending on which expansion I'm playing, make it more interesting with an inn or the builder. On the monastery, you lose the workforce of the meeple for a long time.

In the "Sheep and Hills" expansion, there are vineyards that even give the monastery additional points when it is completed. More OP!

Respuesta 13:
As others have said, monasteries only score 9 points and can tie down a useful meeple for an extended period of time, when it could be used for more profitable purposes. It's often quite easy to frustrate the completion of monasteries with clever tile-laying choices. If you have plenty of meeples free, or many of the 8 surrounding tiles have already been placed, then it can be useful. But, later in the game, when you might be relying on a specific tile which is unlikely to be drawn to complete it, you might think twice...

Respuesta 14:
I essentially agree with what other folks have told you. The other thing that should be mentioned is that player count, or really tile count per player, is also an important consideration. Just using the base tiles, especially if it's without the river, at 3 or 4 players, makes the tension of meeple shortage at least somewhat less intense. With an expansion or two to up the tile count, you have more turns but not necessarily more meeples. All of that makes dedicating a meeple to a monastery a bigger commitment. Then considering what others have pointed out about sabotaging completion becomes even more prominent. Bottom line, there are many considerations that affect whether that monastery is a lucky draw or not.

Respuesta 15:
That's helpful to know. I only have the base game, (an older edition from what I can tell... It doesn't have rivers), and in our game, meeple shortage wasn't really a problem. I don't think that any of us ever completely ran out of meeples. To be fair, I think that we were all scared of that happening, but it also makes sense that having less tiles-per-player would be a factor.

Monasteries are in reality quite a weak source of VPs. Castles, then farms. All other tiles are mostly for blocking / preparing take overs / connecting farms.

Respuesta 17:
In our game, 3 different monasteries scored the 9 points, which certainly wasn’t weak, especially when you don’t have to wait very long to get your meeples back.

The conclusion that I’ve come to after receiving all of this feedback is that monasteries are probably, (and certainly were in my groups case), good, maybe even obvious options if you’re playing with novices to the game, but they aren’t the most efficient/reliable point generators if you’re playing with more experienced players.

I’m sure that cities and farms are still huge point-getters, but in our first game, the monasteries were the most successful and was the ultimate resource that swung the game in my favor.

With more experience, this should never happen. Other players should not help you to finish monasteries, so you are stuck to place tiles around it yourself and these tiles could score more points placed elsewhere.

As has been made clear throughout the thread - and particularly at the start - OP doesn't yet have experience. I don't think it's necessarily taking the conversation anywhere profitable to tell OP it shouldn't happen. Nothing specifically against you @Wildhorn, just we seem to be repeating ourselves now.

Respuesta 20:
@wildhorn Yes, I understand that as it has been repeated to me throughout the thread, and I was never disagreeing with that statement. My point was that my group IS inexperienced, so it isn’t a bad idea to utilize monasteries in my strategy since they are clearly effective at this stage in our play sessions. Claiming that they “should never be effective” doesn’t make them less effective at this point. If my opponents are willing to do the work to surround my monasteries, I think it’s a good idea to capitalize on their willingness.

With that said, I plan on letting my group know how to combat the effectiveness of monasteries, of course. I started this thread so that the game would be more enjoyable for the whole group, not just so that I could have an edge over them.

I believe there still is one thing that has not been said about monasteries yet. They are fairly difficult to close if some opponent(s) actively sabotage them. Then having a monastery-meeple blocked is well possible. All that to get 9 VPs while a single closed shielded castle tile delivers 4 VPs and the castle can also boost your farm.

Respuesta 22:
Good job being open to other opinions, OP! Carcassonne and Cascadia are very different games. It is hard to compare the quality of a game about tile laying in a shared area with one about tile laying in a personal one.

A good rule of thumb for people new to the hobby: the best games from past decades are just as good as the best games from today. The design trends are different because the market is much different now, but you should keep being open minded to time tested classics, because some of them may be your favorite games. Even Brass is from 2007, not ancient but certainly not super new.

The simple math is that a completed monastery gives 9 points for 9 tiles. A city of the same size gives at least 18, but probably even more.
The more complex math is that if you put two meeples in this city, it will give you 18 points. But if you put a meeple on a monastery, and surround it with 8 tiles of city, you will get 25 points points for the same amount of tiles. Compared to the streets, instead of 9 points from street, you will get 17 from one monastery and 8 streets
Also, if you put it on a good place, the other players might need to decide, do they want to complete they object and give you a free points, or leave both their and your meeple on the board.
Yes, there is a risk. Monastery is easier target for sabotages than the other object, but it is not bad at all in terms of pointing. I would say it is more situational.

Yes, thank you!



Tema 3: Best Carcassonne Tactics
Pregunta:
My gf was a non-boardgamer and I introduced her to hobby games with Carcassonne. She got completely obsessed and we started an eternal battle score with currently 27 games played. We are pretty even, so I’ve been starting to research startegies.

I googled this an to my surprise I couldn’t find a single discussion about Carcassonne strategies.

So, I thought I’ll start one. Drop your best tactic, advice or part of a strategy here and we will create the sure win strategy for Carcassonne and for each expansion.
Also, you get to name your tactic a cool name - simply because it’s fun.

I’ll start:
The Wandering Abbott

One eye-opening tactic was how to use my abbott. Instead of placing and leaving it until I need it again, I started pulling it out every time I only placed a tile for extending a road or city. Especially when you play with expansions, there are so many opportunities to play the abbott. This way you don’t only add the points of the tile but you can easily score 3-6 points every time you‘d only place a tile.

Thank you Stuart! I am unsure if I should close this then. There are tons of strategy guides (still surprised my google search and my search in the forum didn‘t turn out anything useful).

Thank you!

Respuesta 5:
The number one tactic that we use is what we call our “Next Move Strategy”. For example, if you continue your city with a CCFF tile, turning it in one direction might require your next tile to match the board on two sides, but if you rotate the CCFF tile the other way, it might require your next tile to match the board on just one side.

The less sides that you have to match, the easier it is to draw the tile you need. Also, when placing a tile that does not help your game, placing that tile so that your opponent has to match more sides will be advantageous to your game!



Tema 4: Carcassonne: Beginner's Strategy Tips & Tricks
Pregunta:
Basic Strategy Tips For Carcassonne

Rule of Thumb: Don’t Rush to Complete Cities

In Carcassonne, there’s a natural inclination to rush and complete cities, which isn’t always the best strategy. Yes, a completed city can score you quick points, but this approach often overlooks the long-term strategic value. By rushing to complete a city, you might be committing your meeples too early and limiting your scoring potential for future rounds. Consider each tile placement carefully. Sometimes, expanding an existing city or starting a new one can be more beneficial. By keeping your cities open, you create opportunities to place future tiles that can significantly increase your score. Always think about how your current move can pave the way for higher scores in the upcoming rounds.

Be a Road Warrior

Roads in Carcassonne often don’t receive the attention they deserve. While they may not score as much as cities, roads have their unique advantages. First, they require fewer tiles to complete, meaning you can earn points and retrieve your meeple faster. And secondly, roads are versatile and can fit in many parts of the landscape, providing more placement options.

Roads also can be a brilliant defensive strategy and an opportunity for sabotage. By building roads, you can interfere with your opponent’s plans and restrict their tile placement options. So, don’t underestimate the humble road – it can be a steady and strategic source of points.

Master the Monastery

A completed monastery can score you a hefty nine points, but it also requires careful planning. Monasteries need to be surrounded by eight tiles to be completed, making them a significant commitment and potentially a stuck meeple until the end of the game.

When placing a monastery, consider the landscape’s existing layout. Position your monasteries in areas where other players are likely to place tiles, increasing the chances of your monastery being completed faster.

Meeple Management

Meeple management is at the heart of Carcassonne strategy. Remember, a meeple, once placed, stays on the board until the feature it’s on is completed. This means that having all your meeples committed can leave you powerless in claiming new features.

The key is to strike a balance. While you want to score points by placing meeples on features, try to always have at least one meeple in reserve. This gives you the flexibility to seize unexpected scoring opportunities that may arise. Think of your meeples as a resource to be managed wisely, not just tools to score immediate points. This balance between scoring now and planning for the future is the essence of Carcassonne strategy.

Advanced Strategy Tips For Carcassonne

Farming for Victory

Farms is probably one of the most complex aspects of Carcassonne. They’re high-risk, high-reward features that can significantly impact the game’s outcome. When you place a farmer meeple on a farm, it stays there for the rest of the game, no matter what. So, it’s crucial to choose your farming locations wisely.

The key to successful farming is to get in early and target fields on the board that you think will have multiple completed cities by the end of the game. You cannot place a farmer on a field that already has a farmer on it. By getting in early you have the advantage over your opponents who will have to find more creative ways of getting into the big lucrative field by connecting up other board tiles.

The big risk with farmers is the prospect of getting into a farming “war” where you and your opponent place more and more farmers to win the field but lose on scoring opportunities due to the meeple commitment. If you find this happening, be cautious not to overcommit your meeples to farming, as this can leave you with fewer options during the game. Striking the right balance is crucial to mastering the art of farming in Carcassonne.

Connect and Conquer

One of the more opportunistic strategies involves connecting to an opponent’s city or road. This move can be a game-changer, allowing you to share or even steal points from your competitors. The key here is to carefully analyse the board and predict where your opponent might be trying to expand. By strategically placing your tiles, you can join their features and put your meeple, effectively becoming a part of their city or road.

This tactic not only earns you points but can also disrupt your opponent’s plans. However, be wary of inadvertently giving your opponent an advantage. The goal is to be a leech on their points, not set them up for a larger score. This strategy requires careful planning, a keen eye for opportunity, and a little bit of audacity. If executed well, it can tilt the game in your favour.

For the full strategy guide, check out my blog Carcassonne Strategy Guide

Respuesta 1:
Each turn in Carcassonne is divided into 3 phases: 1. Draw and Place a tile, 2. Place a meeple and 3. Score a feature. When you start playing Carcassonne your primary objective with each New Tile is how you can score the most points with it - how to maximize your point scoring. As you continue to play Carcassonne, you start to develop strategies for how to maximize your points while minimizing your opponent's points! Eventually, you start to think about your Next Move, then you start thinking about your opponent's Next Move!

The Next Move Strategy


A large part of the Next Move Strategy is understanding what tile could be drawn for making that Next Move.

Memorizing the lists of what tiles are included in every expansion of the Carcassonne game and then combining those lists to know what tiles are available in the current game you are playing is nearly impossible except for the real experts who have played thousands of games.

So, if the Next Move Strategy doesn't depend on that level of understanding, what does it depend on?

Your Next Move and your opponents Next Move will be more difficult if the Next Move Tile has to match 2 sides instead just 1, 3 sides instead of just 2, and 4 sides instead of just 3 makes it extremely difficult!

If the first player in a new basic game extends the road with a RFRF tile and the second player draws a CCFF tile, how should they place their tile? What does the Next Move have to do with it?
or
Placing this tile as shown in the first example will require your Next Move tile to match the existing board on two sides while placing the same tile as shown in the second example will only require your Next Move tile to match the existing board on only one side. 44 of the 72 Basic Game Tiles have a city on at least one side while only 25 tiles have a city on one side with a field on an adjacent side. But you don't have to know the exact numbers to know what your best move is!

The odds of randomly picking a tile that you need is considerably reduced by the number of sides that your tile has to match!

OK, you chose the best placement of your tile for your game, but your opponent also knows about the Next Move Strategy, so when they draw their RRFF next tile, what should they do?

Do they place their tile to reduce the chances of another player completing their feature, or place their tile to complete or extend one of their own features, or, is there a way of doing both at the same time?
or
Yes, both placements of your RRFF tile as shown will cause your opponent to match 2 sides instead of one on their Next Move, but... The one on the left leaves you needing only a 1 sided match for Your Road -?- but the one on the right might also force your opponent to help you Extend Your Road! Ever wonder why the more games you play, the longer it takes you to make your Next Move?

The expansion of your Next Move Strategy is the primary way that you become a better and better Carcassonne player. As you grow in the game you start looking at the Next Next Move, etc.

And, there is also an extremely important reason for expanding your implementation of this strategy, when you limit your opponent's opportunities to complete their features, you are also trapping their meeples on the board, hopefully for the rest of the game!

Tema 5: Started playing this for the first time online; It's fun but I am getting dominated. General strategy/tips for a newbie?
Pregunta:
I've always seen/heard of this game but hadn't learned how to play until a few days ago. The rules and execution of them is very simple and easy to understand, so I picked it up straight away and headed to BGA to play a few games. Of course I was expecting to (likely) lose my first several games, but I got straight up dominated. And continue to get dominated each time. And for some reason, it hasn't been terribly easy for me to "pick up" on exactly what my opponents are doing to employ those tactics into my own future games. Seems like each opponent I've played kinda does something different, but the end result is the same: I lose by a pitiful margin.

I know it's a very situational game, just like any other of this ilk. But also, like many others, there are probably some very general "dos" and "don'ts", basic strategies, or things to definitely "go for" and things to definitely avoid, etc. that I'm very clearly missing out on. I kinda browsed through the forum here but didn't see much, most people here already have a good grasp on the game it seems. Is there anything I could watch/read to help improve my fundamentals, other than keep getting slayed online?

Respuesta 1:
Some general tips might be:

Are your opponents trying to build large cities? Or small cities close together so that they can connect them later?

Try playing a tile that disrupts this plan, or play a tile that can help you connect one or more of your meeples to their city

Are you familiar with how farmers/fields score? (These can be huge point scoring opportunities at the end of the game, so it’s crucial to pay attention to them early)

Try playing tiles that cut off fields or redirects them away from your opponents farmers, but help yours.

Are you leaving too many of your meeples stuck on unfinished features (roads, cities, monastaries), giving you fewer meeples to use later in the game?

Try keeping enough in your reserve so that you’re never stuck without a quick scoring opportunity.

Respuesta 2:
Use and understand the importance of farmers. Around early to mid game, If you starting to recognize a big open field area that can potentially come in contact with three or more cities, set that farmer down or else your opponents will! And don't stop at just one. If you see another opportunity, take it. There's no such thing as too many well-placed farmers in Carcassone.

There's no such thing as too many well-placed farmers in Carcassone.
Running out of Meeples because you have one or two of them stuck somewhere you expected to quickly get them back from will deny you points if you go too heavy on farmers early on.

Respuesta 4:
Some things that may help you:
- Farmers are often a big swing in points, so don't overlook them. It's a guessing game, but try to place them well and close opportunities for your opponent to steal your farms.
- Don't run out of workers, keep at least one for scoring quick points. A small road you can complete or a 2 tile city, for example. Features that pay immediately.
- If you get a tile and you don't know what to do with it, try to place it in a way that disrupts your opponents' features.
- Close your features as quickly as possible, it's better to make a few points and get your worker back, than giving your opponents opportunity to steal your feature or block it.

If you want to be even more competitive, try to learn how many tiles are of each type, that way you will know if it is possible or not to complete a city or a cloister or not.

Respuesta 5:
I think that the first thing you have to learn about the game, if it is not something you already are following, is what I call the Next Move Strategy that is on our personal website.

Basically, whenever you place a tile, consider how that placement will affect your next move and your opponent’s next move.

Respuesta 6:
Well thanks everyone for the tips. I guess I hadn't noticed / realized / understood how big of a role farmers can play, and I was also focusing too much wasted effort on roads (i.e., I'd always drop a meeple on a new tile road if I could, even if it was my last one or if there was no particular "plan" for that road, etc.).

Took some of those strategies into account and won my very next game haha. Got a couple farmers down early on and was able to build some small cities to boost their points and lay tiles to actually connect the grasslands into a bigger space.

If you are playing on BGA with all available expansions you must certainly don't want to start placing farmers early. I sit and watch my opponent placing farmers while we're laying down the river tiles and know already the game is in the bag. 150 tiles left and you think that meeple scoring just nine points all game was a worthwhile move? Nah. Even if that field starts to become more valuable as the game progresses, I'm going to get in on it in the last 25 tiles or so

without that any other strategy does not make any sense, as it will not be a strategy when you don‘t know what you are doing. It will be pure luck of the draw.

Reviews:
"This book is a gem and it deserves to be on every Carcassonne player's bookshelf. On second thoughts, no - it should be kept by the bedside or armchair and actually read because it will help your game."

"For those who think that Carcassonne is a game that depends only on chance and is quite simple, even silly ... Read this book. It will change your vision completely."

"Eagerly anticipated, after a quick flick through the book, I dived straight into the base game strategy. I didn't find a great deal there that I didn't already know about, but that is not surprising since I am in the GB Carcassonne Team after all! A beginner or intermediate player will find a huge amount here to improve their game. Although a lot of how I play is intuition, rather than following rules, it was good to read the theory that underlay that intuition. An example of this is in road building, where the book points out that there are many more tiles that can close a road loop than a road end, so it's often handy to have an unfinished loop ready to close for a quick few points. I had also not considered the possibility of forcing an opponent to close a gap to my benefit, such as leaving no position to play the four-sided city tile other than where you want it to go to allow you to take ownership of a juicy city."

I'm not affiliated in anyway but I know Dan Chard, who is a BGG user, from the Carcassonne Central website. He is a Sr. Administrator there. The website houses everything Carcassonne and he is active in manner facets of the game. I know he has attended the Essen fair and participated in Carcassonne events, (I'm not sure he was involved in the actual tournaments).

In my mind he is very qualified to share strategies with intimate knowledge of background information.

Hey, I'm Dan and I helped Steve to write this awesome book. I thought it might be of benefit to share details of some of my Carcassonne experience here if it helps to assure anyone of the quality of the tips and advice we've shared in the book itself.

I've served Carcassonne Central (an international Carcassonne fan community with over 7000 members) as chief admin since 2014. During this time I've organised and overseen more than a dozen online tournaments (winning a few of them along the way), arranged quizzes, giveaways and special events, maintained a newsletter and even hand-delivered a framed Carcassonne landscape consisting of 140 signed tiles to Klaus-Jürgen Wrede at a special fan-meeting in Essen in 2016. I also run the Carcassonne Central Facebook group and @Carcassonne on Twitter which involves a lot of answering questions and sharing Carcassonne news across both platforms.

Although I've never counted, I estimate that I've played somewhere in the region of 8000 games of Carcassonne which includes games played in person, on Facebook, the last three iterations of the Carcassonne app for Android, the (old) iOS Carcassonne app, JCloisterZone (a free, Java-based Carcassonne implementation that I helped to maintain and wrote most of the FAQs for) and more recently at Board Game Arena where my position in the current "Arena" season ranks me at 14th in the world. Over these last few months I've probably been playing 5 – 10 games of Carcassonne every day. The vast majority of these games are played with just the basic 72 tiles, but I still include various expansions every now and again.

I've taken part in five UK Carcassonne championships, reaching the semi-finals in 2015 and 2018, and the final in 2019. Finally, I was the captain of the UK team in the Carcassonne World Team Championships this year, and despite a disappointing overall result, I didn't lose a single duel throughout the entire tournament and even commentated on several of the other matches on a live stream of the games being played.

With all this in mind, hopefully you'll agree that my credentials justify my involvement in the book and I'm not just some guy who turned up and came second at the UK championships one year. I've attached a recent shelfie though, just in case there's any doubt...

Parts of the book look at ways to maximise your point-scoring potential from specific types of feature without being aggressive or attacking your opponent. This aside, we shared some tips relating to building defensively in order to keep your features as safe as possible from the types of players who may like to attack them either to share them, take them over or kill them off too. However, there is also tips and guidance relating to trapping meeples, counting tiles and playing aggressively for those who tend to play more competitively.

I hope this answers your question.

I'm quite keen on Carc and have even written a few short bits of very basic strategy stuff for BGG. Chancing on this thread I would have been very interested in a book by someone like this. Unfortunately I already own a book by Dee, he published a book largely plagiarized from Ingersoll's introduction to the abstract game Hive, and I would not buy a second book with his name on the cover.
Individual feelings on that sort of thing will vary but for me its a bit of a deal breaker.

Tema 7: Carcassonne a lite gateway game of luck?
Pregunta:
Carcassonne is often citied as a Lite gateway game that involves little or no strategy. It’s a game of chance based on the tiles your draw. But I actually think there is more strategy to Carcassonne than first meets the eye. It’s a balance between short term points (small cities and roads) and long term (farms, bigger cities, cloisters) and if you have the two first expansions the strategic options increase.

It goes without saying that you need to utilise your Meeples. Meeples that are not in play do not earn you any points. Having said that you should never use your last Meeple unless you will get him back immediately, for example when you finish a small 4 point city or 3 point road or place a cloister in a hole.

It’s dangerous to place a Meeple on a farm too early as it ties him up for the whole game. In particular the farms around the river tend to be small and low scoring. When you place a farmer, build lots of little two tile cities on your farm.



Try and box in your opponents farm with roads to restrict the size of their farms. Think about whether the city your about to place will add points to your opponents farm.



Sharing and Stealing

Stealing and sharing are a big part of Carcassonne. Can you steal or share your opponents city or farm by placing a tile adjacent to his feature? If you have some of the expansions look for tiles with enclosed farms. These can’t be stolen.

When you draw a cloister tile ask yourself if placing as a cloister is the best option? These tiles are basically fields and can be useful for stealing opponents farms or extending your own farm.

Blocking and trapping

I tend to keep a city and road project on the go at all times. I place these on the edge of the playing area to prevent myself getting trapped.

Consider placing a tile on an opponent’s feature to trap his Meeple by making it difficult to complete. Running a road right up to a cloister will make it hard to complete. You. don’t need to memorise the tiles. If a tile to plug a hole needs 2 features on it, it’s going to be hard to find. Your opponent might be lucky enough to draw the right tile but chances are he won’t, especially if it’s near the end of the game.




When placing a tile within your city ask yourself are you sure you are not making the city difficult or even impossible to complete? Look around the board. Has the tile you need already been placed? If you are playing with Traders and Builders don’t be tempted to add a tile to a city with a builder in it to get an extra turn if it leaves your builder stranded. Consider finishing an opponent’s large city to collect the trade tiles.



Abbott
If you have the new edition of Carcassonne (with the gardens) use your Abbot to gain points. Place him early and keep moving him so you can pick up four or five points each time you place him. Usually best to use him on a garden rather than a cloister. He is probably your most highly scoring Meeple and certainly your most flexible. There is not point leaving him on 7 or 8 point garden/cloister in the hope your pick up the last points. While you are waiting he could grab a few points somewhere else.

Place cloisters and gardens together. That way when you add a tiles it will benefit more than one feature. Place cloisters where others are building a feature so they can help complete your cloister. They are unlikely to block you if this means they block themselves.




If you have a tile that you can’t utilise as you don’t have a Meeple use it to bolster your cloister, start a city in your farm or block your opponent.

Mayor
If playing with a Abbey and Mayor expansion place your Mayor early on their required tiles as you have less flexibility with these. Then your will have general Meeples left to place on other features such as roads. Remember a Mayor has the value of the number of pennants in the city so beware of placing him on a city without a pennant. However, place him on an opponent’s city and you might be able to add an extra pennant and steal the city.



End of the game.
Use cathedrals and inns tiles that you pick up towards the end of the game on your opponent un finishing features to stop them scoring points. Try and grab a farm or place your last meeple on a unoccupied city nub or road.

For me Carcassonne is a bigger on the inside game.

Russian Railroads, Terra Mystica, Gaia Project, Chess, Checkers, Go, just to name a few.

Carcassonne has some luck involved, but it is a strategy game. Of course if you add 24690728957623485 extensions, you increase the luck factor. But if you play with just the base game, a more skilled player will have a higher win rate.

A skilled player will know how to block another player, will know the probability to draw a specific tile, will plan how to score big field, how to steal easily other player structures, etc.

Respuesta 6:
- There is uncertainty (luck) with the tile draw. But after a few plays, you get an idea of how many of each tile features are in the game and you take calculated risks with when and where to place your meeples.

- You can certainly mitigate the "luck" by trying to 'get in on' or 'steal' and opponent's city, road, or farm.

- You can put tiles near an opponent's city that make it very difficult for them to finish the city.

In my humble observation, the person who claims a game is all luck after the first playthrough, is usually the person who lost. If they couldn't play it well the first time, then it MUST NOT HAVE ANY strategy If you invest a little time exploring the intricacies of a game, your opinion may change.

Randomly draw 6 Scoring tiles and put them face-up on the Game board in random order. Each tile corresponds to a round. (Put the remaining two tiles back into the game box.) Cover the right half of the uppermost Scoring tile with the Game end token.

Randomly draw the required number of Bonus cards and place
them face-up next to one another.
(Put the remaining cards back into the game box.)
And after these setup steps (which randomly influence the game towards non-trivial directions), the rulebook recommends 2 ways to choose factions, both of them involving quite some luck (except for the randomly determined first player in the first method).

I know that in tournament settings you are bidding for factions - that does not involve luck, if you can read minds.

Setup is random, but once set, it is the same for everybody. So no luck involved in the gameplay.

Respuesta 9:
It's a game of 'luck' only in the sense that, say, poker is a game of luck, because players draw random cards/tiles.

But as everyone knows poker isn't really a game of luck except in a technical sense, something that's evident from a perusal of the top names of any tournament. And nor is Carcassonne.

If it was, then the same individual would never have won the Carcassonne world championships four times. If it was luck-based, the world champion would be a different (random) individual each time.

Carcassonne has a lot of strategy inside it. I was so proud a couple of days ago when I managed to expand my farmland to a couple more cities near the end of the game and I won by one point. The beauty of Carcassonne is it's easy to understand what concepts you need to do, but the random nature of games forces you to adapt your strategies in order to outwit your opponents.

While "luck" is certainly present in Carcassonne, I don't believe it's as big of a factor as some might think. Having played numerous games against the "expert" AI on Table Top Simulator, there's no amount of luck in the tile draws that would allow me to beat those bastards. I've yet to score better than last place in about 12 games. Their ability to block, deny, etc, is utterly vicious. It actually changed my perception of the game....

Tema 8: Are you disappointed when you draw a road?
Pregunta:
When I first started playing Carcassonne I used to be disappointed when I drew a tile with just a road on it. It’s only worth one point, hardly worth wasting a Meeple on. Roads are the only feature which don’t have their own special Meeple. Farms have pigs, cities have Abbots and monasteries have Bishops. Roads have no one! Roads are boring.



However, over time and with extra expansions, I learnt those roads can be the key to winning the game.

Firstly you can try and find an incomplete road without a meeple on it. Always consider whether your road tile would let you place a farm or muscle into someone else’s farm. Roads are also useful for cutting off your opponents farm or at least cattailing its growth.



If you have Traders and builders expansion you can use it to place a pig on an existing farm of yours.



Or place a builder if you already have a meeple on the road.



Inns and Cathedrals can double the value of a road if you place an Inn on it. But you take the risk on whether you can not complete it before the end of the game.



The Bridges and Bazarrs expansion finally brought some interest to roads. Bridges allow you to join up incomplete roads.



And the mini expansion The Ferries gives even more opportunities to score the same road multiple times or utilise your opponent’s road.



And if your lucky enough to find the Tunnels promo, then this gives even more scoring options for your road.



The Hills and Sheep expansion allows you to place a shepherd in the field.
And there’s the roundabout tile from the Abbey and Mayor extension.




Are there any other road strategies I have missed?

Respuesta 1:
For a long time, our group has tended to take out certain base set tiles and replace them with the corresponding Ferry tiles. It ensures that there is not a glut of roads, but still adds the tactical layer of that expansion. Also - just the Inn tiles from I&C, again replacing base set tiles where we can. It makes the roads much more interesting and relevant in a base-game timeframe.

Respuesta 2:
The King and Scout mini expansion. Half was for Hunters and Gatherers and the other half for Carcassonne. You keep track of who built the biggest city/castle and who completed the longest road. At the end of game the two players (or the same player in some cases) will then get bonus points for each completed castle and each completed road (respectively). It can make a huge difference as 1) if you have the longest road and there are several small, tiny roads you can score a lot. 2) It sometimes wants you to close out other people roads and castles even if you not in them to prevent them from getting bigger then your own.

Respuesta 3:
Your right I’d forgotten about the King and The Robber. It makes roads much more worthwhile. And the person who finishes the road (rather than the person who built it) gets the bonus.

Respuesta 4:
I've played most with T&B and I&C and sometimes River I, sometimes with its expansion.

Roads are good for trying to section off or over-power farmers.

With the builder, a road can be okay, but not as good as a city. I rarely put more than one meeple at a time on roads.

I never play my last meeple except to get it back immediately from a completed road or city. Toward the very end of the game, I might play him as a farmer.

Respuesta 5:
and   also bring strategy to roads building.

Respuesta 6:
AFAIK, roads can be good to block off cities, but I believe later expansions do introduce the appropriate connections, so it seems roads don't quite get that job done anymore.


And to answer your question, these days, I'm more disappointed when I don't draw a Cloister!

Respuesta 7:
Actually your right. Sometimes it can be disappointing to draw a cloister if you don’t have somewhere good to put it. Also danger of getting a meeple trapped or tied up for most of the game.

Respuesta 8:
I'm not sure how you could finish this thought without mentioning how fantastic roads are at blocking other players' cities from finishing. It's my favorite thing to do! Gets people hot and bothered at the table, and there's nothing better than a little Carc tension!

Respuesta 9:
Sometimes a boring straight road may be disappointing but it is important not to just throw it away. Make sure you get as many points as you can with it as a lot of just road tiles will come up so it adds up to quite a few points.

You do not need any expansions to find the road tiles useful. You need to play in a competitive way. The road tiles can be used to:

* connect / block farms
* make closing castles harder
* completely block features under construction and thus permanently block opponents' meeples
* protect your own features from sabotage / take over

Tema 9: Cooperation, or using opponents to build your cities
Pregunta:
Very early on in the game, the first time you draw a non-city tile, you want to put a farmer into the field. Field control gets you so many points at the end of the game, you want to get a guy in early, so that the cities get built around him.

I have summarized some good rules for strategy, but the full details can be found on my blog. https://boardgamestrategy.blog/2016/12/12/carcassonne-strate...

-Field Early, and Field Late
-Share the cities
-Plan your exit strategy
-Plan for cloisters
-Finish strong

Respuesta 1:
I agree farmers early are a great strategy, but on the first non-city tile? I'd shut that farm out of potential cities so fast by enclosing him with road, and/or putting all future city tiles far away from his supply chain.

I think it's best to give it a few tiles to see how the landscape is evolving; in a way, it's a press-your-luck to see how long you can leave it but still be the first to place a farm...

I disagree with this rule. Having one of your meeples locked so early on generally isn't a very good idea.

Don't get me wrong, it can work out, but you give your opponents plenty of opportunity to mess with it.

This is so true. If you're only playing with 2 Players an "early field" strategy might not be as risky (because the danger of getting "caught" is not that high) but at the same time, the chance of placing a successful farmer later on in the game is a lot higher too. This won't be the case if playing with 4 Players.

Respuesta 4:
I've enclosed the Farm Early player in a three player game. Looped the roads right around and she ended up with just one city and down one follower for the entire game.

The trick to farms is to come at them from the outside in the mid to late game. If you can find a smooth edge of 3 tiles where one of them is a city, instead of taking a football city, you can drop a farmer where you have two ways to sneak onto the big farm. Or if you can find two or three cities on an edge with a smaller field on the "outside," you can farm the back edge for 6-9 quick points, maybe more.

Personally, I would not bother throwing a farmer into a field with fewer than 3 cities in it unless it looked like it was going to be REALLY wide open. And if my opponent takes an early field, I will build my cities on the opposite side of a road (or two or three) where they do not benefit them.

I also don't trust cloisters after about 1/3 of the draw bag, unless I can drop them where they only need 2-3 more tiles to complete them. It's way too easy to lock up monks with "dead" spaces, unless Abbey & Mayor or The Festival are in the mix.

Respuesta 5:
Good point on getting trapped in a multiplayer game. I like the idea of opening up some space before playing your farmer, but you run the risk of someone else swooping into the field first.

Fields are easy to sneak into, so it may not be a risk and you can just plan to sneak in later.

Respuesta 6:
I tend to dislike this version of the game mostly because of Farmers. How about a player who immediately places two of them.

Respuesta 7:
My mum always goes for the early farmer. I just wait until there are a few tiles left and then connect up a BIG Meeple farmer into the original farm and steal all the points.



Tema 10: Do Monks Win the Game?
Pregunta:
I've played my copy of Carcassonne about 8 times now, and I keep getting the feeling that whoever draws the most monetary tiles has a significant advantage over the other players. It seems like the easiest way to gain even 7 or 8 points in a single turn, with no way for other players to stop that from happening.

Have you guys found that to be true?
It makes me feel a little discouraged from playing the game more as it can feel too luck driven as a result.

Sure other players can stop (some of) it. Once you know what tiles exist in the game, you can start using that to your advantage to create spots that can't be filled. It's less harmful than against cities, but it does deny a point or two and locks a meeple up until the end of the game (unless, of course, it's an abbot sitting in the monastery).

Respuesta 2:
No monks are not OP. Often they get tied up for long periods of time waiting to finish them. There is no incentive to partner up on a monastery like there is for a city or even a road. Compare that to 2 points per city section.

Respuesta 3:
The disadvantage of monks/cloisters is that your meeples are tied up until the end of the game if you can't complete all eight of the surrounding tiles. So someone may end up with a few at the end that are worth 6-8 points, but they gave up any opportunities to use those meeples elsewhere in the process.

If this is becoming an issue, I'd suggest playing a few strategically placed tiles whenever you can that make it harder for your opponent to complete their cloister. Or, alternatively, what I'll do with a cloister of my own (if I'm lucky enough to get one) is play it next to someone else's and piggyback off of some of their tiles.

Respuesta 4:
I agree with the other responses so far. I've played Carc well over a hundred times - probably closer to 200 - and cloisters are not overpowered. If anything, they're slightly underpowered as their max scoring potential is only 9 points, yet your meeple is locked up on that tile for potentially the entire game. Compare that to a large city with a cathedral which could net you huge points (I've had one score over 80 points once) which may take just as many turns as a single cloister to complete.

It seems like the easiest way to gain even 7 or 8 points in a single turn, with no way for other players to stop that from happening.
Well, firstly, you only score once the feature is complete, OR at the end of the game, not "in a single turn" (well, you could in theory place it in the middle of 8 surrounding tiles and score it immediately - very rare though). Want to stop another player from abusing the cloisters? Put your own cloisters next to them, thus any time they add a tile next to theirs, it's likely to also be next to yours. Even better, put TWO cloisters next to theirs. Or put a farmer down on farmland adjoining their cloister, so any time they add to the cloister, they're expanding your farm's reach, potentially joining onto lots of cities, or merging other farms (which can net big points when using the Barn from Abbey & Mayor).

Respuesta 5:
Good points! That definitely puts it in perspective for me. I guess I need to play the game more! Haha

I don't have any of the expansions right now. Might stick with the base game, but not sure.

Thanks for the feedback guys! That will definitely come in handy next game.

Carcassonne keeps surprising me. It seems so simple and luck driven, but there's actually quite a bit of subtle strategy to it.

I'm assuming the depth is only improved with Inns and Cathedrals, and Traders and Builders?

Absolutely. Easy to learn, hard to master, as the saying goes. There's a ton of strategy, but a lot of tactics as well due to the random tile draws.

Matt Halowell
@mhalowel

Yep, absolutely. I&C make the roads more worth pursuing (they can be ignored a lot with just the base game) and boost cities too, but with the possibility of not getting ANY points for them if they're not completed by game end. The big meeple is ok (good for taking over other people's cities/roads), and the pig is great (adds +1/city to the farm its on).

T&B makes the game more 'gamery' with the trade goods; it makes completing someone else's city potentially useful as YOU get the trade good(s) even though they get the points. And I love the builder (gives you a bonus turn if you add a tile to a feature on which you've previously placed the builder token).

Respuesta 8:
Sounds cool!

I may have to give those a go a little later down the road.

Respuesta 9:
The only time the monks seem more powerful is in a two player game with only the base set of tiles. You would each only have 35 turns and if you draw a majority of the cloisters it can make a difference.

Respuesta 10:
We play base with Hills and Sheep and The River 1&2 (but no H&S rules...just the tiles) and have a great time with it. It's all we play anymore. But yes, with the vineyards (each adjacent vineyard adds +3 points to a monastery when scored) added in from the River 2 and H&S it can swing the balance if someone gets some lucky draws. We had someone make 45 pts one game between several monasteries that were together all surrounded by Vineyards.

But that's part of the charm of Carc. Yes, it's random...as it should be. Everyone has an equal chance to pull out of the pot so it's not like someone's getting cheated.

Besides, it's meant to be fun. Overcoming someone's luck advantage is part of the fun. There are so many ways to mess someone over in Carc that even if they have lucky draws you should still make them work for it.

I've played my copy of Carcassonne about 8 times now, and I keep getting the feeling that whoever draws the most monetary tiles has a significant advantage over the other players. It seems like the easiest way to gain even 7 or 8 points in a single turn, with no way for other players to stop that from happening.

Have you guys found that to be true?
It makes me feel a little discouraged from playing the game more as it can feel too luck driven as a result.
This was my initial experience, but as soon as I and the people I play against regularly worked out how to maximize farms, the feeling faded.

It probably originates from the fact they score quite simply and aren't difficult for new players to get their heads around.

However if you still feel it's an issue, you could try
- Adding (any) expansions; they will generally add extra tiles which will a) place more cloisters, meaning the odds of one player drawing a majority is reduced and b) the first two in particular add lots of city tiles, making cities a bigger part of overall scoring.
- Adding the above mentioned expansion Hills and Sheep, which features Vineyards, which add +3 to a completed cloister, but you HAVE to complete it to get the points, so you can use them aggressively against people with lots of cloisters.
- Adding the expansion "the cult", which adds "anti-cloister" type tiles which compete against neighbouring cloisters.

Respuesta 16:
I've played 9,000 games and won 8,000 of them. I rarely place a meeple on a cloister. Usually I only do it when I'm placing it in a completely surrounded hole so it will score immediately. Or when there's just one tile left and it will be a pretty common piece sure to come up in the next handful of turns. At the end of the game I generally scored considerably more points for cities, roads, farms and fairy, despite my opponent getting more points than me from cloisters. Generally I finish a game with 100 or 200 more points than them. So, no, cloisters aren't going to win you the game

Thank you very much. I appreciate advice from an expert like you. 9000 games, WOW. I trust your judgement.



Tema 11: Comparing the depth of Taluva and Carcassonne
Pregunta:
A “Depth” comparison based on levels of Strategy and Tactics:
Carcassonne vs. Taluva

These games lend themselves to finding a way to measure depth as they are both tile-laying games that are considered ‘similar’, but will hopefully yield a different measure of depth under analysis. I have also played each of these games perhaps hundreds of times, almost always two-player, where both games shine brightest and the external factors of a social game are minimized.

Both games give an advantage to the first player, with Taluva giving a larger advantage to the first player (unless you play a variant rule).

1. Depth - “layering of heuristics” - being able to identify where it went wrong

Carcassonne - at the end of the game, it is often clear what city or farm was key to the game. This helps to evolve the meta-game where farms are fought over fiercely, and then later almost ignored in battles over large cities, and then back to small cities and farm wars again.

Carcassonne - there are definitely heuristic layers not perceived or acknowledged by new players. Adding tiles to another player’s city to either a) make it too large to complete, or b) make it impossible to complete is a move most new players would never see. Not closing your own city, but carrying it forward a turn is a dangerous, but rewarding strategy (particularly with the old rules where the ‘football’ cities are only worth 2 points not 4). There are even moves where you space your roads out to make them easier to complete if challenged (a move found in Go a lot).

Taluva - at the end of the game, it is often a race to get your hutss completed first, having accomplished the more difficult task of getting temples or towers out first. One person, often the first player, has a slight lead on the other. Figuring out where that lead came from is usually hard to identify. If the first player is leading it may partially be due to being first. If a player had to switch strategies, was going towers and then switched to temples, it can be a little more obvious where the delay was.

Taluva - there are definitely heuristic layers not perceived or acknowledged by new players. Adding a single hut so that the other player cannot erupt a volcano and get to the third level is a low cost move that can waste a whole series of moves they made to make the third level possible. Most new players try to position a hut to try to also gain from level three, but that requires at least two moves, if it works at all, while blocking only uses one move and then you can go back to your own strategic horizon elsewhere. Most new players also try to save their huts, while experienced players are often destroying huts that have served their purpose rather than build up near their opponent.

board state(Taluva slightly ahead)
Carcassonne - created as you play = good number of choices where to place the tile
Taluva - created as you play = almost universal placement L1, less options L2 and L3

legal moves (Carcassonne)
Carcassonne - 3-4 choices per turn with Meeple: no placement & a) farm/cathedral;
b) farm/road/city; c) farm/city; farm/road
Taluva - Must place at least one:a) many places - one hut; b) few places - more than one hut; c) rarely hut/temple; hut/tower; hut/tower/temple

Choices (Even)
Carcassonne - must pick up a random tile - no choices there
Taluva - must pick up a random tile - no choices there

Decisions (Carcassonne) - see goal trees later in the post
Carcassonne - 1. Points 2. Meeple Placement 3. Tile Placement
Taluva - 1. Build all of 2 from 3 pieces: hut, temple, tower 2. Tile Placement

I don’t think I have exhausted the heuristic layers, or feedback mechanisms. While both have similar heuristic layers, Carcassonne seems to have a better feedback mechanism.

2. Tactics - “look ahead”

This is the easiest comparison as both games clearly have this element and it is the most accessible part of each game to players of any level of experience.

Carcassonne - Even before a player understands “stealing” cities/roads/farms etc., they already recognize that cities jutting out from the board are easier to complete than those found within the board, and that getting to a farm “first” is advantageous.

Taluva - Even before a player understands “blocking”, they already recognize that certain patterns are safer than others from opponents, while other patterns are easier to create a third level, and being next to a variety of land types is better than being next to a bunch of volcanoes (although later, that may lead to better level two opportunities. Also, a double land type makes a settlement quickly; key eruptions destroy a potential temple quickly, etc.

I think these are fairly even. Taluva is a little harder to predict because of the 3-D element and the potential for lost huts over time; while Carcassonne has a wider variety of pieces and paths to points meaning more decision making over which is the optimal choice. I am going to give them even scores here.

4) Strategic Efficacy - the power to produce an effect on the game board state

Both games have the players creating the game board anew each and every game; a very fun, interesting and satisfying game mechanic. After each game, the players can look over the entire board and indentify unique patterns to that board; holes in the board; location of pieces (clumping, strung out in a line, disjointed, etc.); location of key events (level 3 or even 4, a very large farm that was missed or fought over, a particularly large city or pattern of cities); key plays can be recalled and seen in an overall perspective (see the section on “depth” and heuristics).

I have personally divided strategic efficacy into 4 parts, though think there are more variations I have not thought of now:
a) length of game control - can you end the game quickly and/or drag it out?
b) conflict control - can you force conflict and/or make it not happen?
c) social game control - can you change the game through deals, co-operative play, treaties, ganging up, revenge, etc.?
d) exclusive ownership control - can you continue to use/play/control a piece after its initial “play” or placement?

Carcassone - aside from creating the board as you play
a) length of game control - the game end is pre-determined by the 72 tiles and cannot be sped up or slowed down - no efficacy
b) conflict control - no certain way to stop an opponent from trying to sneak into a city or farm, although controlling with plus two more meeples than them discourages interaction; some tile placements can make cities inaccessible to farming, while some tile placements make sharing a city/farm easier/more attractive - overall some efficacy here
c) social control - the control over if a game is cut-throat or you work separately on your own cities and roads, etc. is mostly social; not challenging the other play, may lead to his not challenging you, and challenging often, my lead to him challenging back, but the strategic horizon should control challenging behaviour more than what the opponent does or doesn’t do - very little efficacy here
d) exclusive ownership control - IF you place a meeple on a tile you have quite a bit of ownership of both that tile, and any tile connected then, or in the future; you also have the choice of closing early or later and/or staring new somewhere else vey often in the game. To lose control, the other player must establish control nearby, and then survive at least one turn before he can join the two areas. You have several choices in cutting him off: complete his part city/road, physically make connection impossible, physically make connection more difficult requiring more pieces than before, etc. - there is a lot of efficacy here

Overall - a score of 0 + 0.5 + 0.1 + 1 = 1.6/4 (40%)

Taluva - aside from creating the board as you play
a) length of game control - the game depends on the depletion of pieces, or the inability to continue playing, therefore you have some control over its length (could get out all huts very early and then lose because you cannot play); you could also try to drag the game out with a lot of single huts; but, overall, the game’s length is fairly easy to determine, the amount of time left is calculable, and if you want to win, it is hard to go ‘faster’ or ‘slower’ except that faster = larger risk of running out of huts before you have the more difficult piece out, and slower = conservative placement of huts until you are sure you’ll get one harder piece out (see strategy 3 for another alternative). Overall, some efficacy here.
b) conflict control - the fact your opponent cannot erupt and destroy an entire settlement means you can prevent some conflict and actions (a good blocking strategy); also, the arrangement of tiles can also prevent eruptions (which is why towers are so difficult), safe play is rarely the best play, but it can control interaction. You cannot force an opponent to interact against you and no interaction is possible, so there isn’t firm control here. Overall, some efficacy here.
c) social game control - again, the tit-for-tat nature of eruptions and blocking creates interesting meta-game situations, but generally, the social game is relatively unimportant to this game. Very little efficacy here.
d) exclusive ownership control - taluva is different in that you must place both a tile and at least one piece (unlike Caracassone’s place a tile and perhaps one, and only one, piece); and that you can place the piece(s) on places far removed from the tile, essentially enacting two tactical moves at disaparate areas of the board, rather than always on the tile you laid (allowing Carcassone fewer ‘good’ double strategy moves). Heuristically, I think they balance out, however when it comes to exclusive ownership, Taluva jumps ahead:
a) Caracassone - you can own a part of the tile you lay, the other parts are open to either player, and that ownership can be taken away. All the action takes place locally.
b) Taluva - you can own the tile you lay, or any open tile. If it is lost, you always have at least one tile nearby the area which is now enhanced a level and therefore more desirable (ie/being killed is not always a bad thing) AND the other player cannot take over ownership (just subtract your ownership) unless he is also positioned nearby. Next, if you don’t lay on your tile, you can place the tile in such a way that it is in your own sphere of influence and makes his taking ownership of it a real disadvantage. Finally, you can extend your ownership from one tile, to 1-4 surrounding tiles, making a small area control into a rather large area control in one move. (Carcassonne, you can only ever increased your controlled area by one tile/one city - except in the case of cloisters - but the “control” of the surrounding area there is nearly negligible).
Overall, Taluva has sphere’s of influence, direct control, the ability to end control (mosty), and the ability to create a landscape advantageous to your own strategy (going up or across) through the placement of tiles and pieces. A lot of efficacy here.

Overall - a score of 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.1 + 1.2 = 2/4 (50%)

Taluva edges out Carcassonne as having more Strategic Efficacy.

3. Strategic Horizon - setting a long-term pathway to the winning conditions

Carcassonne - The long-term goal is points from a) cities, b) roads, c) cloisters, d) farms. Each has a cost in terms of the lost meeple time, the points you might gain, and the ease of completion.

a) Cities - as a strategic horizon in and of itself (not farms)
(old rules) - need three tiles to be worth it: min: 3, max: 9, average: 4.5
- double points make it a more valuable point source than roads
- easier to make un-complete-able than a road (especially in base game)
- in expansions gain value through trade goods and cathedral triple points
b) Roads - two tiles is enough, often better as a secondary objective as are found on city tiles - smallest points (expansion adds some value)
easiest to complete, often left empty by opponent when placing a city tile
- a good secondary goal, but not a main strategy(allocate 1-2 meeples only)
c) Cloisters - a tactical opportunity rather than a strategic horizon
- at worst, 8 turns, but sometimes a small number of turns, even immediately
- gain 9 points, therefore, if you are doing all the surrounding equal to a road
(1 point each)
- very easy to make un-complete-able
- roads and cities of yours can help but more potential for incomplete objects
d) Farming - as a strategic horizon
- Once they are placed they’re gone - huge investment
- (old rules) - min: 0 points, potential: 4 x each city you dominate
- fairly easy to steal unless you waste time blocking
- two point cities become very valuable (now 6 pnts)
e) blocking your opponents moves - no meeple time necessary
- only pnts of opportunity, no other point gains, but keeps pnts close
- wasted time if they complete - roads are often used in this manner

Overall - you have 36 tiles to play with. If you set your self the goal of 1 point a tile, you should have 36 points at the end. If you just play your own game, and let your opponent play theirs, with no real interaction, you will lose with 36 points. With a lot of interaction, 36 is a respectable score but in no way a guarantee of winning. This type of strategic planning is a red herring.

The 36 tiles however, tells you that cloisters are a waste of time, as they suck out meeples for too long, some almost a third of the game, for little reward. Road strategies also net too few points. Cities at least let you aim for 2 points a tile, and they mitigate any tiles used for other purposes to keep you above 1 point. Farms need 9 cities to get you 1 point a tile if sought exclusively, plus any city points you made (if the other player made the 9 cities they’d probably have 40 points).

Point comparison: How to get to 9 points?

Roads - need 9 tiles - often some are others, often requires several meeples
Cities - need 4.5 tiles - often can be done with one or two cities, 1-2 meeples
Cloisters - need main tile, plus 7 after placement (some yours, some not)
Farms - need 1 tile, but connectivity to a large space
Blocking a city from closing - need 1-2 tiles to minus often 9 points or so

General strategic horizon - allocate meeples (7)

1) Balanced Strategy:
2-3: roads until mid game and then transition 1-2: farms
2-3: start cities
1-2: support cities, later support a farm, tactical opportunities
1: always keep for tactical opportunities (can often grab 3 points or even 9 off cloister, also, if meeple-less, opponent can take huge advantage)

This strategy has some corollaries:
a) must not get involved in an escalating farm war,
b) but must instead must use a meeple to simulate a challenge to get the opponent overextended (hopefully early) into farming,
c) block city completion for heavily invested farmer, take full advantage of lack of meeples (a whole other discussion of how to do), and
d) be aware of opponent often having no better move than trying to block your points and get your meeples trapped to re-balance the game.

2) Farming Strategy:
3: Farming with small cities works as it is low investment of meeples in cities, returned immediately, and so can heavily invest in the farm. Can use roads to block a run-away game by the opponent.
1-2: roads, can transition to farms if needed (leave one for a long straight road)
1-2: challenge the cities of opponent where not on your farm to make it bigger and tie up his meeples to defend
1: Keep one meeple for moments of opportunity.

3) Competitive Strategy:
2-3: Challenge every city with either blocking to trap a meeple (best done as early as you can - less valuable in the late-game) or try to steal, or at least tie.
1: one road only, when you there is little advantage in using as a blocker
2: cities, keeping them small (ideally 3-4) and getting your meeples back quickly’
transition one or two to farming in second half of the game and/or support challenge on farms
1-2: meeples of opportunity that is kept always to edge you ahead of the opponent

This strategy has you winning by a small margin, so every small margin matters, but, your meeple management matters more. Don’t get dragged into heavily investing your meeples in any one place - meaning leaving points lying around that your meeple advantage should allow you to claim later more often than your opponent.

I would love to know if there are other Strategic Horizons out there for Caracassonne? My measure is 3 large ones, with many tactical variations. The strategic horizon must be set-up fairly quickly as your meeples can all be on the board by the 7th move of 36 if you are not careful and you are then committed.

Taluva - the long-term goal is to get all your pieces out of your hand :
a) huts; b) temples; c) towers; d) before the other player does
In two-player games, the chances of the tiles running out almost nill.

a) huts - Level 1: min. place one, but can often expand 2-5 Level 2: often only expand 2, rarely 4 Level 3: rarely expand huts
- a single is invulnerable, after that you want a row over different levels, or large to be safe
- huts are rarely your first concern as a large settlement makes starting new ones harder for yourself
b) temples - one tile to start the settlement, and then one more can be enough to get a row of three, often need 3 tiles though
- your opponent erupting within a settlement with a temple is an advantage to you, starts a settlement
- You can complete 3 temples with about 6 tiles minimum, but more often closer to 12-15 tiles
c) towers - placing alone, it takes a minimum of 6 tiles, positioned well, to make one tower
- your opponent can place one hut on L1 and grab L3, (often blocked easily)
- You need only complete 2, but it requires a lot more “look ahead” than temples
d) blocking your opponent - one tile can often really disrupt the carefully laid plans of an opponent
- using a hut to block, means the tile can be used to build up somewhere else
- Volcanoes give a small measure of blocking if surround an opponent (risky)

General Strategic Horizon - which two pieces to get rid of?

1) Huts & Temples

The easiest and most often sought strategy of new players.
a) Create one hut quickly, ideally with a L2 in the middle of two L1’s on each side; add temple;
b) cut out the one hut touching the temple, ideally placing two huts on the other half of the tile (L2) and then another temple.
c) The third temple often has to be elsewhere and is built off the back of a double land tile.
d) race to get all your huts our by uniting your settlements and growing upwards

2) Huts & Towers

A harder strategy horizon, requiring a fair bit more tactical ‘look ahead’
a) Create one hut quickly, ideally with a L2 in the middle of two L1’s on each side; (often add the temple too)
b) cut out the one hut touching the temple, ideally placing two huts on the other half of the tile (L2)
c) this time, don’t place a second temple (if you have one), but instead begin building upwards to L3 and place the temple such that the opponent cannot
d) start your level three by adding a hut near the opponent’s settlement and then as you kill his huts with eruptions,
e) you keep on the edges to sneak into a L3 spot from a single hut (the singles also help prevent his blocking your going up by forcing where eruptions can and cannot happen)
f) in the race for huts at the end, you have access to a number of L3 and L2 locations.

3) Temples & Towers

A strategy I use when the other player is inexperienced. Since huts have to be used to build towards Temples, and at least one must be played each move towards a Tower, this strategy is very counter-intuitive.
a) use huts to block eruptions and the expansion of the opponent, while using the tiles to build up to the towers (keep a lot of singles so they cannot be erupted over) - ignore all chances to expand unless invulnerable
b) if an opportunity presents itself (a very safe row of three, or a double land type tile) you may make the row of three for a temple, but you have no time yet to put out a temple as your tiles are needed to be building up
c) after the 2 Towers are out, place any temples you have pre-prepared; then use the Towers as the start of small settlements spread over several levels

4) Blocking Strategy

Blocking is really only ever a tactical decision of opportunity, or a nice secondary action. The decision:
a) when the placement of a piece helps your strategy, is if the tile should be used to block or should you begin setting up good end-game expansions for the final race of hut placements and/or be building up for getter later huts
b) when the tile is being used to help your strategy, should the piece block or should you expand to deplete your supply of huts

The optimal decision depends on whether you are how many tiles it will take to overcome your block; does it ultimately give them higher levels to expand into in the end-game race; does it prevent or delay a temple or a tower (obviously, preventing a tower is both easier to do and always a great tactical move).

Overall Carcassonne and Taluva have three over-arching strategic horizons, with no huge advantage to either, except in Carcassone, there is more choice and decision making within the stategies and the tactical decisions of opportunity are more varied and sometimes harder for new players to see or successfully pull off. A slight edge to Carcassone.

5) Layers of Uncertainty

a) randomness of outcome:
(Taluva slightly closer to the Euro system than Carcassonne)
Carcassonne - commit to a city/road/ cloister/farm and then hope it gets completed - only the city penalizes if incomplete
(farm debatable)
- the luck of the tiles can be important if know there are three left, count on getting one, and don’t
Taluva - commit to a hut (sort of), commit to building up (sort of), less dependence on tile luck, more strategic, little randomness of outcome
b) randomness of opportunity:
(Carcassonne has more decisions after the tile draw)
Carcassonne - there are a wide number of opportunities with the tiles:
i) cloister in a snug little corner
ii) that piece that just fits
iii) the corner road is always a great way to join a farm, or score three points
iv) end road pieces score easily
There are a lot of things trying to pull your meeples onto the board and you off your strategic horizon
Taluva - there are less opportunities with tiles: a) double land type b) expand a bit larger, Since the tiles are so modular, it matters less
c) randomness of players(Taluva more deduction)
Carcassonne - there is some deductive planning, particularly with cloisters near where an opponent is building, or fear of being made un-complete-able
Taluva - there is much deductive planning against or for eruptions and L3 positioning

6) Goal Trees - sort of

Carcassonne -
1. Get Victory Points: a) within the game b) end game
B. End Game Scores: i) farmer dominates ii) roads/cloisters what expected (1 pt)
iii) cities get half of their hoped for value (1 pt)
A. Within Game: i) farmer = 0 points iii) City = best points (2 pt)

7) Complexity = variety and breadth

Variety both games have no variety in their set-up conditions
Carcassonne - 24 distinct tiles, total 72 much more distinct
Taluva - 25 distinct tiles, 48 total much more uniform
Both have similarly sized strategic spaces (mostly closed paths to victory)
Both have fairly simple rules, low complexity of their goal trees, and low breadth.
Note: see some great images of all the tiles in Carcassonne being used, with no road or city leading off the page: http://norvig.com/carcassonne.html

Both of these games are, I think, quite deep, but they lack the breadth of games with a fat rule book, a wide variety of winning conditions, and long set-up time (not to mention more layers making them more fun, whereas with these two, more players is not more fun).

Overall, I will leave out the layers of uncertainty and levels of complexity as they balance in these two games almost perfectly 1:1.

Final Scores:

Depth (Heuristics) - slight edge to Carcassonne - both rank highly
Tactics (Look-aheads) - even - both rank medium
Strategic Efficacy - slight edge to Taluva - both rank low
Strategic Horizons - advantage Carcassonne - both low/medium
Layers of Uncertainty - slight edge to Taluva - both low
Goal Trees - advantage Carcassone - both low
Complexity & Breadth - even - both rank low
The winner of depth seems to Carcassonne 3:2, based on the criteria heuristics, tactics, strategic efficacy and strategic horizons.

Carcassonne - a deep lake, but not very wide. Depth score of 3/5 (60%)
Taluva - a little less deep lake, also not very wide. Depth score of 2.5/5 (50%)

A final note:

Carcassonne has a wealth of expansions. Except for Inns & Cloisters, Builders & Traders, few have become popular with enthusiasts. Clearly, these two make the game “deeper” (at least that is my first impression), but a subject for later analysis. The others tend to add luck, or clunky heuristics.

Taluva has no official expansions. Alternative rules, however, make the game a lot deeper (at least at first glance).
1) an end goal where you have to deplete all three pieces, while always being able to make a legal move = less end goal decisions, but more mid-game strategies and some control over the length of the game that could be useful to winning.

2) adding a second set (or even third), to make the game longer, encourages people to suspend making a strategy decision between temples and towers until the game has progressed to almost mid-game (doing both when you can until a path becomes clear after the accretion of small tactical advantages pushes you in one direction or another); a greater variety of final board designs, opportunities for interaction, places for the second player to pull ahead of the first player.

3) adding a rule that the second player gets one more move if the first player goes out first, making it a tie if both players go out on their last turn to cancel the advantage of going first - this sort of tie happens a lot with experienced players I have found (anecdotally).

Future Project - which is “deeper”? Race for the Galaxy (RftG) or Puerto Rico?
While this may seem like an exercise in futility, as they are so similar, my hope is that through careful analysis of actual games that have a lot of parity it will become easier to give an actual measure of “deepness” to a game with a score or leveling process for games that are dissimilar.

Respuesta 1:
Very interesting.

My biggest problem with Taluva is that the placement of huts/towers/temples is very abstract. With Carcassonne, the rules for placement of tiles and meeples are easy to remember. With Taluva, it's always, "So what must be placed on level three fields?" and "Which of these pieces is the temple?" etc...

Tema 12: Where would you place this tile and why?
Pregunta:
How about a little real-world strategy discussion. If you've played Carcassonne on a a device, then you've probably racked up thousands of sessions and observed countless scenarios where you weren't quite sure where to play a tile. So why not post those scenarios here?

Let's assume the 3 basic tactics for placing a tile include:

1. Add points to your own
2. Share points from your opponent
3. Block an opponent

Here's the board. It's blue's turn.




The options appear to be:

1. Finish 4-point city and add to blue cloister
2. Build new 4-point city and add to existing blue city
3. Add to existing blue city (under blue road) and add a second meeple to it
4. Attach to red city

Thoughts?

Respuesta 1:
I don't know how these bots work, but I would risk putting the tile in the lower left corner, to help finish the blue cloister, close the small city and put a farmer there.

I believe the purple player has a farmer in that specific field already. If I am mistaken on that point, then I agree that this would be the best move.

If that field is indeed already taken, I would go for option #2.

Respuesta 4:
If there were more finished cities, I would add to the city on the bottom right and add a farmer. But because there is not, and it is a 3-player game, and blue has 2 meeples left, I would pick option 4) and try to share/steal the city. It is at least 2 points for that meeple, and potentially much, much more.

Respuesta 5:
I'd try to move into the big city, as well.

4) attach to the bottom of the red city and place a farmer on the field. You or Purple will try to fill in the gap between it and the monastery. If he does then he just put you on the farm that you will share. If you don't get on the farm somehow you will most likely lose.

You will have other opportunities to grab/share the castle and/or block it so it can't be finished.

On top of that after looking again... you can ballpark estimate that there are only about 3 tiles left that will allow red to finish that castle. With 3 players odds are against red finishing it right now.

Respuesta 11:
Especially because all blue needs to do to make it impossible to finish is to play a road adjacent to that spot. This also locks down one of purple's meeples for only one point.

Respuesta 12:
I probably would go with option 2 b/c I'm a big advocate of getting the cheapo points. I wouldn't be so against trying to latch onto the big city for 2 reasons:

1) Purple and you both have an incentive to put that piece down (67% chance of grabbing it).

2) Prevent a possible block-in by red...assuming that can amass 8+points from that uncompleted city...edging out the blue cloister and definitely beating the 1pt purple has invested with its one meeple.

Alternatively, I'd even consider blocking me out to block the others...assuming I can out score them with everyone one meeple down.


I'm an aggressive Carc player though...so any chance that I can trap a meeple and edge out a few points..I'm going to take it!

Respuesta 13:
I would go with option 2 but not claim the small city. Instead, I would place a farmer on the field and then join it to purple's field.

Respuesta 14:
Option 2, not too bothered about getting into the field as there are plenty of tiles to go and I suspect they'd be another opportunity e.g. the other side of that city, then cloister on a road at the other end of blue's road, yes blue might not draw the cloister tile but that looks like a great place for it and making it costly for other players to put it there might be worth doing. My experience of the android app is that the bots have played me into high scoring fields if it gets them a decent number of points too, and even occasionally when it doesn't.

Awesome replies. Thanks!

A couple comments:
The Witch (purple) player is "evil" and will commonly play a piece to block her opponents. The Count (red) is "strong", so above average player with above average aggressiveness. Yes, the iPhone version scores 2-tile cities as 4 points.

My hesitation of finishing the 4 pt city was the risk of AI trying to lock in my cloister. Although I see now that any tile played at the top-left corner of my cloister would still allow the top-middle cloister piece to be finished. I'm assuming this is the "risk" that Jaroslav was referring to.

Han Show First, Why wouldn't you have started the big city? It only has 3 edges to completion. Is that too many? Would it have been worth it if it had a pennant?

My hesitation of trying to share red's city is that it's not a very high value ie. no pennants. I'd be giving up 1 meeple in hopes of sharing an 8/16 pt (incomplete/complete) city.

Now, the question of whether to complete the existing 4 pt city or score the unclaimed 4 pt city. I feel like taking away a quick 4pt score from my opponents is better than finishing a 4 pt city of my own. It's still 4 points to me, but also limits my opponents scoring options. And, in this case, also completes 1 side of my (blue's) larger city. However, I'm now remembering the reason I placed and claimed the large city piece at the bottom-left was to "assume" the inclusion of the unclaimed tile into my city eventually.

I agree that it's too early to worry about the farm, 46 tiles remaining is plenty of time to get on it.

In Summary,

1. It's too early to worry about the farm
2. The red city is either not big enough or not close enough to completion to worry about sharing it yet. There will be more options for that later.
3. Finishing the existing 4pt city and adding to the cloister is a strong option.
4. Claiming a new 4 pt city and adding to the existing big blue city is another strong option since it still claims 4 points for blue but also adds to the big city.

I'm inclined to agree with your assessment of the situation, except in one specific point: In counting points, I prefer to count the points that will (probably) be added to my final score by the particular play rather than those that are scored at the time. To clarify using this situation as an example: by adding to (and finishing) the the one-tile city next to the cloister, you would be adding three points for the city, not four (because one of those points is already essentially yours) as well as the one for the cloister, adding a total of four points to your score. Taking the unclaimed city in the bottom left would add four city points plus one in the adjacent city that you've already claimed, adding five points to your final score. So as I view it, the latter play is one point better, and as you say, it removes easy points for your opponents. (And also as you say, there's still plenty of opportunity to try to share the other developing features, which aren't really all that juicy yet).


Elaborating on my point above, I think it's common for people to over-value a play to complete a city they already own. The play shouldn't be valued as 2*(tiles + pennants), because some of those points are already yours, even if they're not yet on the scoring track (setting aside for the moment the possibility of another player sharing or stealing the points). A more accurate formula is 2 (or 4 if the tile you're placing to complete your city has a pennant) plus 1*(tiles + pennants already in place).

Having said that, I'll still agree that finishing your city does ensure that nobody else will share its points, so depending on the stage of the game, you may well be justified in considering the play's value to be more than the strict point value obtained by the calculation above.

Respuesta 18:
Interesting. I'll have to start incorporating that point evaluation during my game play. Obviously there are other factors to consider when placing tiles besides just points (eg. blocking, meeple churn, etc.), but this seems like a more accurate way to assess the points gained by a tile.

Thanks!

Any play by another player to lock in your cloister man would be a fairly neutral move seeing as both other players would have a man lcoked on roads. Best for red who has four men in hand.

Han Show First, Why wouldn't you have started the big city? It only has 3 edges to completion. Is that too many? Would it have been worth it if it had a pennant?
I try to keep cities only with one open side at all times. So I only start a new city with a single segment. I might consider starting a city with a double segment if I had plenty of men, and I had no city being built to add it too or it had a penant. I almost never put a man on the city part of a triple. I prefer to farm, or block, or complete a 2 point road.

Same goes for the road above it. With 4 men in hand instead of two you could put pressure on the other players by farming early and you would not be so worried about getting players stuck (indeed you might want to block your own cloister with the two opposing roads).

Have you been thinking about this the whole time?

Respuesta 22:
I agree, this is a good blocking option, especially since it freezes 2 opponent pieces. However,when deciding my placement I usually give lowest preference to blocking moves and give priority to placements that improve my own situation. In this case I like the move of completing the small city in the Southwest and either claiming the other small city or placing a new farmer.



Tema 13: Am I Doing This Right?
Pregunta:
I put down 2 farmers every game. Is this more or less than I should? Although; I will put down as many as the other player(s) put down. Am I doing it right?

Respuesta 1:
That depends on the situation of the game. If there's only one big field and only you have a farmer on it, then one is enough. If the tiles form many fields and/or fields are disputed, then you gauge the pros and cons.

Respuesta 2:
I agree with Moshe. I would just put down whatever felt appropriate for that particular game. Usually that would be at least 2 farmers, but not always.

Respuesta 3:
The number of farmers dictates ownership. A few plays ago, my wife and I fought over one huge farm. We ended up placing five farmers each and cancelled each other out. If there are two farmers in a farm you want, you will need to dedicate three farmers somehow to take it.

Respuesta 4:
I find that I usually place one or maybe two farmers in the early part or main body of the game and then, towards the end as my other primary features are cleared up, I will often place more, often claiming a field with only one or perhaps two cities. Remember these little fields are worth three/six points, which may not seem like too much, but having meeples in hand at the end of the game does you no good at all, so I aim to get them all out, often placing my last meeple on my last tile, and at the end, you'd be hard pushed to score morethan three points on anything except a small field (or a cloister if you get lucky).

Susie_Cat.

Respuesta 5:
As an average, I end up with more than two farmers in most games. Oftentimes I will have one or two set out in the mid game, and then be working some in towards the last 15 tiles or so. Oftentimes, my last couple of turns, if I still have meeples, are best spent by placing one or two more farmers on little farms (three points may be my best option if I don't draw that tile I've been waiting for!).

Respuesta 6:
Agree with everyone here. Also though depends on how many and which expansions your playing with as there can be lots of tile and lots of big farms.

Respuesta 7:
I'd say I (usually) only play maybe one farmer during the first 2/3 of the game. Towards the end we often end p fighting to steal each others' farms, so more farmers get played, and my last two plays are often two farmers on small fields for 3-6 points. (You can often stick some field on the outside of a little city on the edge of the map, this is usually worth more than the short roads left unclaimed, but not always.)

So by the very end of the game, I think most people have more than two farmers out, but not until the very end.

Respuesta 8:
Farms in the base game are generally pretty powerful, but don't get sucked into group think about it.

If someone claims a farm you can try and limit the scoring from it by cutting off the farms with roads, or just building one very large city on that farm.

Another tactic can be to join 2 of your opponents farms together to reduce the value of it (because they are probably feeding the same cities twice with 2 separate farms).

Farmers tie up your piece for the whole game, so if your opponent has 2 or 3 farmers down you can use your extra meeples to score points throughout the game.

Its always situational though, which is what makes Carcassonne a solid game.

Respuesta 9:
I think one reason some people wind up thinking farmers are "overpowered" is that they somewhat forget about farms until the end of the game, not trying to limit opponent farms or add to their own. It's like a random point bonus at the end of the game. Instead it should be an element of your strategy throughout the game, then farms will be much less decisive, and when they are, that will be a battle you're fighting rather than just hoping to win.

Respuesta 10:
I usually get one farmer down early on, then add others later; maybe another one or two in the midgame (especially if playing with expansions that give you more meeples).

Towards the end of the game I tend to be getting meeples back from completed cities and roads, and if I'll only have a few more turns I look for small farms available with 2 or 3 cities and put farmers on those. There probably won't be time for anyone to steal them from me, and the six or nine points for each of them can be well worth it. Even three points for a single-city farm is decent at that stage.

Respuesta 11:
Quote:

I use that tactic as well. I call it "backfarming," short for "backside farming" -- it's usually a farm at the corner/edge of the play area with 2-3 small cities. placing on the farm on the "back" side of the city gets quick points, which are hard to come by in the final tiles.

Respuesta 12:
Laying farmers is definitely situational. I have played games where I lay down a farmer on the first available tile I can, but I have also made it my last play of the game. I wouldn't get to caught up on a number of farmers or how soon or how late to play them. There are too many variables to consider when or if to place a farmer. My advice is to pay attention to how many cities are available on the area you are planning on farming, and if it is in a place that will get you cut off from expanding your farm. Meeple Management is key. You don't want to lay a farmer down that ends up getting you 3 points and not have that one to put on another feature that will get you more.



Tema 14: Avoiding 'Infinite City'
Pregunta:
I have a problem. I love Carcassonne. I REALLY love Carcassonne. But there's a thing that bothers me, and that is that what seems to happen every game is at least 2 what I've nicknamed 'infinite cities.' These cities just go on...and on...and on...with few end pieces in site.
It's not a BIG problem, it's just annoying. Should I try to avoid this, and if so, how? Or is this just something that's supposed to happen; a quirk in the game. Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
It just happens. Unfortunately if you have a meeple on the city it is typically gone for the rest of the game - fortunately you get a crap load of points at the end of the game for the incomplete city.

When I realize I have a city that isn't likely to be completed by the end of the game I just keep adding more and more tiles.

Respuesta 2:
Play more. With experience, you will learn to either close those cities before they get out of control or abandon them before they eat too much of your resources. Big mad cities are a natural stage of learning to play Carcassonne well (because most players are tempted to build them but it takes skill to see when it is indeed a good move to go for a bigger city).

Respuesta 3:
The Inns and Cathedrals expansion solves this to some extent. It includes two cathedral tiles that render a city worthless unless it is completed (if that is the case then it provides a scoring bonus). The threat of someone dumping a cathedral in your city provides a strong deterrent to making it excessively large.

Respuesta 4:
Steve N
@ReggieMcFly
The threat of someone dumping a cathedral in your city provides a strong deterrent to making it excessively large.
But if you have Traders & Builders, you perhaps want them to add the cathedral to your city, then complete it (maybe with another player) and reap a whole lotta points.

Respuesta 5:
Rather, the threat of adding a cathedral makes it a good move to expand your opponents' cities into unfinishability as they desperately try to finish them before you draw that cathedral. This can backfire if you give them too many points and they do manage to finish.

Really, you'd like your opponents to have the unfinishable cities, while you score twice as many points by actually finishing yours. If everyone has cities unfinished by the end of the game, you're all ending up with significantly fewer points than you could have. Whoever learns to finish more of his cities will start winning more, and this should balance itself out.

Respuesta 6:
Is the Infinite City causing that player to win? I would suspect not, because completed cities are worth more points (as has already been pointed out).

I think you are suffering a little from Group Think. Try claiming a farm and then add lots of small cities to it. Soon enough you will be asking us how to beat the Mega Farm

If you were to consider an expansion, I'd suggest  . The builder generally helps to build cities quicker, plus the trade goods mechanic gives you an excellent reason to finish cities (and sometimes gives you a reason to finish an opponents city...).

Respuesta 9:
In my experience, "infinite cities" are generally caused by multiple players vying for control of the same city. To avoid this try to select your tile placement to avoid an easy two tile access to your city by other players. Sometimes this means not adding to the city, maybe even starting a second or third city. Working multiple cities at once gives you more choices for tile placement.

Respuesta 10:
We call them "Metropolis" cities in our gaming group. I personally don't think they're a huge deal, but I would avoid excaberating the situation if possible. You get points for the incomplete city, yeah, but that also means it messes up your farm game.

Take advantage of infinite cities when it's convenient, but don't let them happen if you can avoid it.

For the sake of clarity, I'd like to highlight that a Cathedral is a new type of tile from the expansion  .

Respuesta 13:
There is nothing wrong with it. By the end of the game you don't want to have any meeple left to place. If you can't dump on a road or a farm why not on a city? Look for cities with pennants too. Also, you need to take some risks. Sure meeple will get trapped and you'll lose some points, but over the long term and many games it will pay off.

Respuesta 14:
To avoid infinite cities be really careful when placing tiles that have 3 or 4 sides of city. Don't keep placing them all together. Place one and then wait till you get one sided city pieces to close them off.

If you have tower or dragon you can always take out your own meeple if your follower is trapped in an infinite city.

On the other hand remember if there is no cathedral you still get 1 point per city tile so you can still get a decent chunk of points from a huge city.



Tema 15: Big Cities/Roads: Whats the Point?
Pregunta:
I had a realization the other night, lying in bed while I couldnt sleep: What is the point of making big cities/roads? Wouldnt it be a better strategy to ALWAYS close out a city or road whenever possible?

The exception would be when you have an Inn or a Cathedral in your city/road to try and make that as big as possible.

It seems that 10 small 4 point cities would be just as effective as 1 large 40 point city. Am I right? It also frees up your meeples to be placed as farmers and negates anybody from trying to steal your points.

Im going to try this next time we play.

Or does this not work for some reason?

Respuesta 1:
Smaller cities are harder for your opponent to muscle into as well.

Respuesta 2:
Sometimes you don't draw the closing pieces you want, so you use the pieces you do draw by adding them to your city. Other than that, though, yes, I would never plan on making a city larger than a few tiles. (In the absence of expansion rules that give benefits for it)

Respuesta 3:
Usually when I end up with a huge city, it's not on purpose. Like when I'm *thisclose* to finishing a city, and then I draw the tile that has nothing on it but a city, and that's the only place I can possibly put it.

Respuesta 4:
Apart from what the others wrote and what I agree with: big cities or roads score more points, but they also tie your meeples for a few turns. The bigger a city is, the more players will attempt to steal it from you. I prefer to finish one as soon as possible. Building many small cities and installing a farmer in a strategic location pays off more for me. IMO, a big road is a safer option (but less valuable). Most battles are over farms or cities.

Respuesta 5:
If you're using Traders & Builders, you have a reason to keep extending a city or road if your builder is in it -- it gives you another turn. If you start a new city it'll be two turns before you can get the builder in there and start getting those extra turns again. But in general, yes, if you can finish your city you might as well do so.

Also, if you finish a city, you're not guaranteed to be able to get a piece that allows you to start a new one in a place that you can reasonably expect to finish it without someone else muscling in. This is less of an issue with roads, since they tend to be easier to extend.

I agree with your logic, and this is part of the reason why the original scoring had a 2 tile city only worth 2 points, and all larger cities scored 2 points a tile. It was to encourage building larger cities which encouraged stealing and more player interaction.

it may be a slight diversion from the topic to also point out that   has a scoring like this, where 2-tile items score the same lower amount as incomplete items.

Respuesta 11:
For me it depends on the number of players. In a two player game where I will draw more of the tiles I will try for larger cities...but with more players and less direct tile control, small is safer.

Respuesta 12:
4 Point Cities can only be built with one kind of a tile. You wouldn't get very far trying to build only these.

But usually I also try to close my cities fast before they get taken over or even worse blocked.

If you have already one or two cities growing and draw another "non-closing" tile you'll usually just build your existing cities bigger instead of starting a 3rd city and binding even more meeples.

I'd go ahead and build the city in that case. A two-edged city piece doesn't hurt you because it doesn't create any more open edges than you had before. In most cases, it doesn't make the city harder to finish - it's just more points. And it's always dangerous to leave unclaimed cities started, especially if you have Princess and the Dragon, since those have portals that let players put a guy on any unclaimed feature.

But a road tile is worth 1 point regardless of whether it is finished or not (providing there is no inn on the road) whereas a city tile will only give you 2 points if it is finished but only one if it isn't.

Also there is the issue of another player attempting to steal your feature. I will rarely try to piggyback on someone else's road but almost never steal it outright. But I will often try to piggyback on someone else's city and if it is worth it and I have the opportunity, I will try to steal it outright.

That's the way I play now, it's much better because it really encourages starting 3-tile cities.
I've played both versions, and with the 4p one I felt I had more obvious (boring) choices: if you can, close them footballs. That's all.

Respuesta 20:
If you've got 5 small open cities, that ties up 5 of your followers. If you've got one big open city, that ties up one of your followers. If you're working one or two small cities at a time, and closing them as quickly as possible, you're keeping a lot of your followers off the board, where they aren't doing you any good.

Respuesta 21:
Sorry for opening a dead forum, but I wanted to add that I will sometimes add an open city tile to an an opponents large city which they've almost closed, especially toward the end of the game. If I add it to my city, I might not finish it, and if I add it to an opponent's city, they might not finish and therefore score half the points for it.



Tema 16: I can't win a three-player game
Pregunta:
I've been playing the base game for a while, on the iPhone with my husband or a stranger and now using the actual game against either my husband or my husband and my 13-year-old daughter. I can win the two-player game just fine, but I can't get a strategy that works in the three-player game.

My husband is pretty aggressive with the farmers, while my daughter NEVER goes in the fields. If I go head-to-head with him, competing for the fields, my daughter wins; if I hold back and don't compete for the farms aggressively, my husband wins.

There's no way to get the best of both worlds? Also to ensure that her cities aren't feeding his farms and vice versa? The point is to make them really work for their features.

Respuesta 2:
Farming is a very big deal in carc. so get yourself setup to move in on his farms, then wait until the end to move in on them, he is betting you because he has a head start on farms and then just has to stay ahead, combat this by getting your self poised to link you farms with his but wait untll the end to do it, this way he will feel comfortable with his farms and wont try so hard and then you jump in at the end giving him less time to get another farmer in, and fight your daughter by stealing her cities and building yours small to feed your farmer, a small city is only worth 3 points just like the large ones so more larger cities may work.

Respuesta 3:
I think the flaw is that you're using the word 'compete.' Which is ALL that you do in a two player game. In 2 player, I bet you don't move the score markers when you block people in fields and castles and roads!

But the reality is tha BOTH players score in a tie. (Pretty sure that's true, right?)

I assume when you said "aggressively", it mean that you put down a lot of meeples to make sure only you have the points and he doesn't?

As someone said, > 2 player game of Carcassonne is more like a leeching game. You just have to share some farms with your husband, and share some cities/roads/cloisters with your daughter. When playing a > 2 player game, I usually stop thinking about putting more meeples down on a feature than the other, but think about which player is the lowest scoring now so I can share the points with him or her.

Respuesta 5:
Thank you all! It's true, I haven't been thinking in terms of sharing as much as I should, and I do instead try to get more meeples in than the other person. For instance, if I encroach on my daughter's city, I then try to get a second meeple in instead of ending the city with us each having one meeple and sharing the points.

It makes sense to share a city with her and share a field with him. Then I get the points for both, while he just gets the farm points and she just gets the city points.

But he is very good at taking over a farm completely before I even see it coming; we very rarely share a farm, but rather, one or the other of us owns it completely. (Usually him.)

Maybe I'll try more sharing combined with a focus on not adding points to the farms that he's likely going to own anyway. I have had some success in penning him in so that his farm is only worth three or six points, and I can often get my daughter to work with me on that.

Another strategy element that I haven't worked out yet is when to finish a small city vs. starting a new city vs. adding on to a big city.

Respuesta 6:
I always find in a 3-player game that if the other two players are fighting over a big city or a big farm, spend your time instead making more and more small cities and roads in another area of the board, making sure you put down a farmer for them all. That way, you're racking up points quite often for all the cities, and provided you hold onto the farm(s) you'll get loads of points for them at the end.

Strategy suggestion: Make sure you don't deploy too many meeple in the first stages of the game; keep around 3 meeple in reserve as long as possible so you can try to share or take over other players' farms near the end. I tend to put no more than 3 farmers down in the first half of the game and use my other 4 meeple for scoring cities/roads. Then as the game gets towards the endpoint, start putting farmers down right next to other farms, then join them up on the last remaining goes [if the tiles are kind enough to let you do so!]. Doesn't always work, but it's worth a try.

Also, if you happen to be playing with the Abbey & Mayor expansion, the Barn can be very powerful in swinging the score, as you can completely take over other farms, then continually join other farms of your own to your barn farm (provided its big enough to warrant it) to get immediate farmer scoring when you join them. A friend of mine managed to win with a 400-point lead using this strategy (though he no longer gets to do that very often as we're now wise to his cunningness).

Respuesta 7:
This is my story! I generally win at a two player game, but add any more people and I might as well hang it up.

I win at two player because I find a way to get ahead and then stay ahead by sharing everything I can. Once I am ahead, say by 7, I don't have to win more points than you, I just have to share them so that I am still 7 points ahead.

With three players, I just don't do well with the farmers.

All very good advice, but this made me raise my eyebrows. With barns in play, early farmers are fine, but they are an awfully big commitment in Base Carc. I think I maybe play ONE farmer in the first half of the game, and sometimes none at all. Boxing in the early farmers and globbing on to farms late can be worth just as many points, but you have more meeples available for features for most of the game.

Don't underestimate the penultimate-turn 6/9/12 point farmers. It only comes down to one big farm if you let it.

Respuesta 9:
Here's what I'd use for a 3P game. I actually use a lot of these tactics in 2P, but they work just as well.

When a field gets to 3-4 cities, it's probably worth dropping a farmer on it. Why? Almost everything other than a city will score 9 or fewer points anyway (only an absurdly long road or 4+ tile city can exceed this).

Especially good is if you can set up your farms to "double count" cities. In other words, if you have access to a field, late in the game, that is completely cut off from the main field "behind" cities and roads, farm both sides! You'll get points for both farms (in the current rules, not the classic rules). Unless an opponent connects you somehow, but they probably have their own problems to deal with. The big thing here is knowing what can/can't be connected to the main field. IMO, it's not that difficult to score 24 or 30 points on farms in this manner. After all, why fight for the big field at the end if you can get 3-4 little ones that are just as good?

In games with 3+ players, make sure to try to share the BIG cities. This means setting up to work your way in to any city piece with 2 or more city edges (the diagonals, the center piece, and the 3-ways). If you're on the farm and they're not, someone's 4-point city won't matter if you get 3 points for it, and if you can farm it from "both sides," that's a +2 swing to you.

Try to encourage people to help complete your features. I like dropping city pieces next to my opponents' cloisters, because if they want their meeple back, they almost have to help me out. And if I complete my city, it's 2 points a tile vs. 1 point for them. If I'm stranded, well, so are they, so it's even.

All in all, you want to share as many of your opponents' points as possible, while hoarding your own at the same time.

I don't always win at Carc, but I tend to finish in the top 2 almost every time with these tactics, and reasonable luck (not drawing 3+ roads in a row).

That's very true; sorry, I rarely play without I&C and T&B these days, and not often without A&M too. With just the base game, yes, don't deploy too many farmers early on or you'll either get them boxed in or on a low-scoring farm area.

Thanks for these ideas, too. I just lost two more three-player games tonight. I lost the first by only three points, though in that one, my daughter surprisingly and uncharacteristically played the fields. The second one, she didn't, and I lost big. I think I could have won the first one if I hadn't drawn, and put meeples on, four cloisters near the beginning of the game, only one of which was completed.

I do try to play the little fields around the edges near the end of the game, and I do try double-playing them, as someone said.

Sharing cities works well in my family, but my husband refuses to share the fields. If he so much as suspects that I'm trying to horn in, he devotes all his energy to making sure he has total control. Sometimes I try to put one meeple in his field, knowing that he'll then try to overwhelm it with his own, thus tying his meeples up. He gets the same number of points for one farmer in a given field as for four, after all.

What's frustrating is that my daughter appears to use absolutely no strategy whatsoever, and she still kicks our butts.

I feel like I have some ideas to work with, though, and I'm excited to keep trying to beat these people with some new strategies.

Respuesta 14:
From a game theory point of view, your husband is engaging in a strategy which causes him to win if no one competes with him, and to lose if at least one player competes with him.

Your sister refuses to compete with him, so she will lose every game if you also refuse to compete. Your husband goes blind-nuclear on the farms, so he will lose every game if you also go for farms.

Both of them are playing strategies where you can force them to lose every game, and you have no incentive not to force them to lose since you have no way to win.

So they are playing sub-optimal strategies which force you to lose and let you decide which of them also loses. The best approach is to demonstrate to one of them that they cannot persist in this style of play by using mutually assured destruction.

I think the best bet is to go nuclear against your husband, since he seems the most competitive. You can demonstrate (and explain) to him that if both of you go all out on field while your sister does not, she will win thanks to the meeple advantage.

You can demonstrate and explain to him that since your sister plays the 'no fields' strategy, his 'fields or bust' strategy forces you to lose. As long as he forces you to lose you will also force him to lose. He now has to change his strategy or accept continual defeat.

The most obvious way for him to change his strategy is to share the fields with you for most of the game, rather than wasting early/mid game meeples in competition. This will allow you and he to both have a strong advantage against your sister and win virtually every game until she changes her strategy and shows an interest in fields.

Even when you share you will both have a strong incentive to go for last minute field-snipes, and this will tend to determine which of you wins, but you can at least avoid piling meeples into the fields in the early/mid game as your husband currently does.

Respuesta 15:
Just curious but what scoring rules are you using? The original or the newer International rules?
From the wiki site:

There are two older editions of Carcassonne, differing in scoring of cities and fields. Though, until recently, the first edition scoring rules were included with English releases of Carcassonne, third edition rules are now included with all editions (including the Xbox 360 and travel versions), and are assumed by all expansions in all languages.

In the first and second editions of the game, completed cities covering just two tiles scored two points (one per tile) and one extra point for every pennant that resides in the city. This exception is removed from the third edition, in which there is no difference between two-tile cities and cities of larger size.
The greatest divergence in scoring rules between the editions of Carcassonne is in scoring for fields. In the first edition, the players with the greatest number of followers adjacent to a city were awarded four points for that city. Thus, followers from different fields contributed to the scoring for a city, and followers on a field may contribute to the scoring for multiple cities. The second edition considered different fields separately — for each field, the players with the greatest number of followers in a field scored three points for each city adjacent to the field, although points were only scored once for any given city. The third edition removes these exceptions and brings field scoring in line with the scoring of other features.

Yes, this is exactly it. I did tell him, yesterday, some of the things I've been thinking about and reading on here. Try as I might to share everything with both of them…neither of them will share at all. As soon as I get one meeple in, they overwhelm me with more. I may be able to convince him to try, though, because it's true that if I compete on the fields, he doesn't win.

Yesterday I came within one point of a win, mainly because his main field turned out to be worth only 12 points, while I had two small side fields worth 6 and 9 each.

The other thing I need to focus on is keeping his field from becoming huge. I love that Carcassonne seems like a fairly simple game, but there's so much to think about. It's not easy to control someone else's field and also manage your own projects.

Tema 17: Strategy from the computer version
Pregunta:
This isn't a thread about the computer version. It's a thread about strategy learned by losing to the computers, and how it applies to the tabletop version.

I've been playing a lot of single player Carcassonne recently against four computer opponents. The iPad version has two computers each who are "easy, hard, mean, and weird". I've been switching though different combinations to see which I can beat. I have beat two hard + two of any other, though it's certainly not guaranteed.

One thing that surprised me was how low scores got with certain combinations. The "mean" computers try to prevent you from completing anything you've started, by throwing down tiles to prevent city, road, or cloister completion, trapping your meeple. All of them (except "easy") do everything in their power to get a "piece of the action" so to speak for any given town, constantly trying to tie up or take ownership through by building nearby in ways that almost force linkage.

It's just the basic game, but with some combinations the end game scores are as low as in the 30s, while with other combinations they get up into the 60s-70s.

As I've learned to beat the computers, I've had to adopt their tactics. What I don't know, though, is if those tactics will translate very well into the tabletop game. I've always played that version as a "completionist" - where to a large extent I work on my things and others work on their things, and while I'm trying to win, filling in the board is also a worthy goal. I certainly don't try to be a jerk about messing with folks or trapping their meeples on purpose, and I rarely try to keep extending a city (to the point of preventing its completion) just to get a piece of the action.

So my questions are, to anyone who plays the computer version, or who has used similar strategies in the tabletop version, do they work? Or do you end up making all the other players gang up on you because of your perceived hostility? Or do you and your gamer friends generally play a more cutthroat version in general and this is normal?

Note that I don't play any of the meeple removal expansions. My brief experience with the tower made it clear that those create a more cutthroat game than I usually enjoy.

Respuesta 1:
The short answer is: it requires balance.

You must try to get in on or block others' features (road, city, field). That is essential. But to what extent? That's where the balance comes in. Sometimes you just have to decide that placing another meeple would overcommit you. It's important to keep some meeples free for opportunistic scoring, and to defend/build up your own features.

So yes, it is very important to be a bit hostile. How hostile? Hostile enough to give other players something to worry about, but not so hostile that you lose the no ability to build up your own stuff.

Respuesta 2:
Note that once two cities are joined, their owners become a team... Except, of course, if one has used the large meeple or attacks with another one.

Tema 18: What's the break on number of players and the importance of a farmer-based strategy?
Pregunta:
I played my first 6-player carcassonne game last night, and what I was so amazed about was how different one approaches the game with 6 players as opposed to 2-3 players. With 2-3 players, you can start a castle and be reasonably assured you can somehow finish it yourself. With 6 players, it's important to get others to do your work for you as best as possible.

So I was curious to learn more about this, where one strategy gets to be more important than another, so-on and so-forth. Assume a relatively non-confrontational expansion is provided.

1.What do you feel about the importance of a farmer-based strategy in Carcassonne, per the number of players. Assume the most basic non-confrontational expansion you can think of.

I find farms to be less important in games with more players because there will be fewer completed cities at the end of the game on average, therefore fewer available farm points.

I actually play it almost exclusively as a non-two-player game. As a two-player game, it is not very interesting. Mainly an excercise in tile-knowledge/blocking with a heavy dose of probability/risk-management. With more players, at least it is fun.

Admittedly, I haven't played many of the expansions, but that has to do with my unwillingness to spend time on expansions of games I only find mediocre.

I think it might be mostly due to my ADHD, but I prefer it as a 2-3 player game...but I think I prefer almost every game to cap-out at about 4 players unless there's something really special that happens at x players.

Honestly, who likes downtime between turns?

With carc though, I do like the 2-3 player game a little more. I like the control a little bit better.


I'm really glad I did this poll, because I'm going to go back and play the 2 player game with more of an emphasis on farms.

I have Carcassonne for the iPod Touch and when playing online I noticed a lot of players actually doing this. They will often play one of their meeples in a farm very early into the game, so early sometimes there aren't even completed cities in the area.

Respuesta 2:
One of the guys I play with will regularly (and fairly consistently) put what he calls a 'fat farmer' (i.e. the big meeple) on one of the opening 'river' tiles (especially towards the lake when there are no roads around) and construct an *enormous* farm around it. We are talking about >10 completed cities here! When you put the 'pig' into the equation it is not uncommon to score one lap of the score track for 'farms' alone.

Respuesta 3:
When we first played Carc, farmers always got placed late in the game. Gradually, we began placing them earlier, as we caught onto the potential scoring. Now, we often see a farmer placed within the first few plays. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.

Tema 20: Carcassonne Tournament! I NEED HELP!!
Pregunta:
So i'm playing in a Carcassonne tournament tomorrow for the first time. Its at the FLGS with 20-30 players and I believe its using just the BASE game.

I have played Carcassonne dozens and dozens of times but I have never bothered to develope a real strategy before. Do any of you have any suggestions on how to dominate the tournament!?

Any fool-proof strategies?
Great ways to edge an opponent?
Focus on Farms? Cities?

If you have played in a Carcassonne Tournament before, how did it go? What was the strategy that won?

Thanks for your help!

Respuesta 1:
It's hard to have a strategy in Carcassone because the game by nature is very tactical. Unless you are playing a variant in which you have a hand of tiles, there is simply no way to plan ahead.

If you have an iPhone, maybe download the app and play a bunch of games against the computer. The tougher opponents are pretty good/aggressive.

In general look for ways to be aggressive. Find ways to glom onto someone elses big city. If you can't glom on, find ways to make it hard for them to complete cities of their own (i.e. by placing inconvenient roads).

Be very wary of leaving yourself meepleless. Sometimes the opportunity is just too good, but look for alternatives.

Draw great tiles, and become a part of every large city and farm. :-)

Respuesta 3:
Well, if you've played that much you probably have a decent handle on the game. Just do your best and report back to this thread on how you did. There are no 'dominant' strategies to Carcassonne, really, though some might profess to know of one or two. It totally depends on the draw and your opponent's meeple placements.

Respuesta 4:
This might sound like bad advice or too much work but...

Try to learn what all the tiles look like roughly. If you know how many of each tile are in the box, then it gets a lot easier to know if you should be starting that new megopolis or just capping of small cities.

Respuesta 5:
My rules of thumb:

Don't leave yourself meepleless.
Draw good tiles.
Don't place farmers too early in the game.
Draw good tiles.
Score as many 2-tile cities as you can.
Draw good tiles.
Try to use your last couple tiles to claim a small farm with 2+ cities for a easy 6+ points at the end of the game.
If you get a tile that has no obvious use to you, place it in a position next to your opponents cities/roads to reduce the nubmer of tiles they can add to them.
Get a little lucky.

Respuesta 6:
This is great! Thanks for the advice! It is a simple game, but hearing those rules of thumb help build my confidence in winning this thing tomorrow! I'll let you know how it goes, and keep the tips coming!

Respuesta 7:
So I just got home from the Carcassonne tournament at Game Night Games in Salt Lake City, and I think everyone had a great time! We ended up with 13 players at the start and played with 3 tables of 3 and 1 table of 4. We played the base game with only the 1st River expansion.

It was a great experience and I learned a lot about Carcassonne. I'll get to that in a minute. I didn't do very well, I got 11th place out of 13. Ouch! Hopefully I do better next time

So in my first game I decided to play an aggressive style. The pace of the first game was slow as each of us seemed intent on making sure our plays were smart. Because of that the game was fairly high scoring with 2 of us going over 100 points and the 3rd place not being far behind. I played aggressively and decided to focus mainly on the largest farm on the board as it touched almost every city in the game. I played a number of tiles that didn't help me much but ensured that my opponents would be unable to capitalize on certain opportunities. The deciding moment in the game came down to one piece that was drawn on one opponents final turn that put a 3rd farmer on my 1 large farm area. I only had 2. So the majority of my time in the game was wasted and he took the points. I still ended in 2nd place but without as many points as I'd hoped.

In my second game I was playing against my good friends wife and another woman. I decided to make sure my path to destruction in the last game wouldn't be repeated and I decided to dominate the main farm in the game. It wasn't as big as in the last game but worth the attention none the less. So I put 3 farmers down early in the game and worked my hardest to connect them. Unfortunately I never got the 3rd one in and I managed to come in 3rd.

In my last game I broke the cardinal rule and ran out of meeples chasing dead end roads and broken cities. I had no meeples to play for probably half the game. I was reduced to playing almost every piece trying to just screw my opponents. I couldn't even help my own position in the game as my pieces were deadlocked and helpless. Needless to say I was crushed.

The final table took place and the winning player was 1st in every game he had played that night. Well done!

So here is what I learned from this experience. There is WAY more strategy in the Carcassonne base game than I had ever realized. I figured the winner of the tournament would end up being someone who did well but had a few bad games along the way. But the play was dominated by one player who did well in every game he played. I learned that there must be more strategy to the game that is perhaps deeper then I was able to tap into myself.


I also realized that running out of meeples in your first 8 turns is the best way to lose.

So thats my report! Thanks!

That sounds like a lot of fun Eric! I have played in quite a few cutthroat games of carc' but never entered a tournament. I will have to keep my eyes open for one now that I know what to expect.

I think the second most important thing is to know the frequency of certain tiles. It is usually fatal to wait blindly on just the right tile, but you have a great advantage over your foes if you know how many are left that fit certain areas. That knowledge can be used offensively and defensively.

The most important thing, as has been stated repeatedly, is to draw good tiles.

Good luck in your future games!



Tema 21: Crowded crowded crowded!!
Pregunta:
This is a BIG BOX... really big, lots of tiles and lots of playing pieces.

The 3 of us starting playing, adding more pieces and tiles every tile we played. We had the travel edition for a long time already, but thought it was more depth we needed.

We all agreed tho, that no matter how fun those tiles are,.. those playing pieces are way too many!!

The funnest thing about carcassonne is the constant question "Is THIS new project/road/building/etcetc something i wanna invest in????"... this is only caused by the limited number of meeples (7) that each player has.

lately we play with 7 meeples, 1 large-uber-meeple, this trading-car, the mayor, the hugeFarm...

that means we now have 11 instead of 7 models to place, and on top of that we get farmers in return since they arnt permanently 'lost' due to the big farm.

Is it just us or does this really ruin the concept of the game????? There was no way of getting rid of all them puppets!! throwing them on tiny roads, building 3 buildings at the same time, etc etc.
How does your playinggroup experience this?? If also troublesome, what was the first piece that had to stay in the bigbox??? (we really hate that trade-car-thing.... hardly ever surprises anyone)

Respuesta 1:
I scale how many pieces I use based on how many people there are. Mostly to prevent fields from becoming too powerful (they are already powerful enough at 3 points/city)

I never use
* pigs
* barns

With 2 people I typically only use
* Base game
* The River II
* Inns & Cathedrals and/or Traders & Builders

With more players I pick and choose which expansions to use but I almost never use all the rules. Sometimes I just add the tiles, sometimes I add the tiles and extra wooden pieces and rules.

I actually find the cart to be mostly useless. Typically I'll place it down and finish a feature only to have all surrounding features either taken or finished so I just get it back like a regular follower.

Just the other day I played a 4-player game (Base Game, Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, The River II, King, and Cult) using all the rules (with exception of pigs & barns) and I had 4 guys stuck, my wife had 2 guys stuck, father had 1 guy stuck, and my mom would have had 2 stuck but my wife helped her. At some points in the game my father had no guys left in hand. So I would say if you want a tighter game, remove the barn and then trap your opponents.

Right on, Phil! Carcassonne expansions seem to add width but no depth. The base game is elegant and offers plenty of opportunities for tactics. I don't think the base game needed fixing or expanding. You don't see expansions for chess. There's a reason for that.

The reason you don't see expansions for chess is because people would rather sell you a variant that either uses the same pieces or adds a few along with some extra squares (essentially the same thing as an expansion).

I like Carcassonne, but am NOT a hardcore player, so I don't expect to win any games, ever, unless it's a 2 player setting. I need to refer to the tile distribution sheet to determine what tiles are left, and even then, thinking that openly may slow the game down, so I don't really do that as much as I would like.

I like playing with expansions since to me, they provide more of a good thing. In a recent 4p game with I&C, T&B, and A&M, that took 1 hour 20 minutes, but that's with looking up rules midgame to check up on stuff. We sped things along by having someone who went to pick their next tile ahead of time to think ahead. Towards the end, we stopped that as to NOT intefere with the trader mechanic.

That's one and it doesn't look as though anyone is playing it. If chess were expanded the way many board games are, you'd have a bigger board with a few new pieces with slightly different moves.

My point is a good game doesn't need expanding. I think Carcassonne is a good game.

There are a few of that out there too. Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_variant for a shortened list of variants - including ones with larger boards to accomodate additional pieces with different moves.



Tema 22: Early farmer gets the game
Pregunta:
I've been playing this game for a couple of years now. I play with my spouse and sometimes with my 10 year old daughter as well.

This game is the one that gets to the table the most consistently. I've probably played it 200 times in the last couple of years.

The only consistently winning strategy to this game that I've found is this:

*The early farmer takes the game.*

Most games will usually have one field that is bigger than any other. I've found that plopping down the farmer first, and subsequently sneaking more farmers is the most consistent winning strategy at this game. Usually in our games the first farmer gets dropped with more than 60% of tiles left to play. The rest of the game is spent jockeying for field supremacy. A lot can also be said for judicious placing of farmers at the end of the game where you can score for smaller, untaken fields, sometime getting 3 or 4 cities in that field - a way better score than 1 point for a road, or 1 point for an incomplete city...

The advantage to the early farmer is that you don't need to play 2 tiles to get him in - he's already there. The other advantage is that it immediately places your opponents in a defensive position, getting in their heads, and distracting them from optimal tile and scoring opportunities.

The disadvantage is that early farmer placement would seem to rob you of a scoring meeple, but somehow the advantages almost always outweighs the disadvantage.

So next time you play Carcasonne, drop him wayyy early - and see what happens next!

Respuesta 1:
While farmers certainly can score a lot of points, there are two points which I think slightly mitigate the overwhelming advantage you seem to find.

1. Carcassonne plays very different 2-player than with more than 2 players. With more than two players, if two players get in a "farm arms race" then the other players can easily use their superiority in "meeple liquidity" (for lack of a better word) to score more than enough points to beat the two players sinking all their meeples into fields. I've seen this happen multiple times.

2. Even if there is only one person on a big farm (or in a 2-player game), the other players shouldn't play into their hand. If you're building cities, make sure they're big cities. If someone is building tons of two-tile cities (2 points for them, 4 points for the farmer), then they deserve to lose. Making sure cities are big, or that the field is small (by blocking it off with roads) can help to thwart a farming strategy.

That said, farms do score a ton of points, and I frequently emphasize them in my strategy. The more that everyone is aware of their power, the harder it is for any one person to run away with the farm. Even if the score is lop-sided in the end, there might have been a very hard fight to win that one big farm, with multiple people sneaking in lots of meeples.

If the first farmer wins, and the first farmer's being played at 40% of the way through the tilestack, shouldn' someone wise up and drop a farmer at 39% of the tilestack? And when that's dominating, somone else go even earlier? And this one-upmaship continues until it reaches the point that the first farmer DOESN'T win (because he's placed before enough cities have been established that he can be exclued from the 'real' high-scoring field).

It just seems like an odd statement - if the first farmer always wins because it's placed after a field of too much power has established, clearly the other players could have and should have placed their first farmer earlier - bringing the first-farmer-placement-time ever closer to a time when its supremacy is actually in question.

Respuesta 3:
I find smart opponents can hem in an early field with roads and cities, limiting the points that early farmer can score. If a player only dedicates one farmer to the field, it is quite easy to sneak your own farmer in to tie on points. If they put more than one, it begins to dramatically limit the number of cities/roads/monasteries that they can participate in. Plus, other players can usually claim those same points by putting late farmers on the back side of the same cities.

What I'm saying is, if an early farmer is going to be worth a lot of points, it usually limits the points they'd get elsewhere and/or requires dedicating more meeples to the same field (thus reducing the value per farmer). It may get decent returns, but rarely determines the game.

Respuesta 4:
2 strategies to counter the early farmer.

1. Build big cities - try to outscore the farm. Usually comes in very close in scoring - but still on the losing side.

2. All or nothing go for broke big farm superiority. I usually find this is also a losing strategy - because you're usually 2 tiles behind, and wasting other scoring opportunities.

Respuesta 5:
I can't claim to have as many games under my belt as you, But I have played quite a bit with 4 and 6 players. This strategy does not work. All that an early farmer does is excite everyone else in competing for farms. A lot of meeples are laid to waste tending crops instead of earning actual points.

No, a better farmer strategy is seeing where the big farms have developed and sneaking your farmers in towards the end of the game. That way, you have been earning points for other features and not useless sacrificing meeples in the early game to keep a farm.

I think you must be playing by some set of rules other than the one that came with my game. In my game, completed cities are worth 2 points per tile, so a two-tile city is worth 4. A farm is worth 3 points per completed city it touches, so that would be worth 3 for the farmer.

In older versions of the game, a city that's only 2 tiles is only worth 2 points. Only larger cities are worth 2 points per tile.

Respuesta 8:
I agree that an early farmer can lay the groundwork for a solid agricultural business... but in the games we play (usually a 5-6 player game with the base set, Inns and Cathedrals and Traders and Builders tiles), early farmers are going to have "friends" unless they are in enclosed fields.

By the end of our games, 80-90% of our meeples are in fields, with some highly productive fields having 4 or more meeples tied in.

Yep, you are playing with poor players.

Next time you see an early farmer simply ensure that you never start a city in that field and that the cities that are started in the field are never scored (remain unclosed). It isn't hard. Oh, and see what you can do to trap some of their other meeples so they don't score and can't be retrieved.

I totally agree with you.

Also I've experienced that with more expansions brought into the game, it gets harder to do a good farmer-strategy. Farms can be closed and that leaves that person with one less meeple to play with. If you play with people that remember which tiles are left in the game, it gets more and more risky to place meeples on the board, because they can end up on a road or city which will never be finished. In that case putting a meeple on a farm early on in the game is a big sacrifice.

But still, in every case, there is just one supreme point in time when to put the meeple on a certain farm and that leaves the game in total balance.

You're joking, right? An end of the river acts like a cloister with a single road. Other than that, the farms should be broken up by all the roads, unless the other players either *want* to have one big farm, or don't know what they are doing.

With the 3rd-edition scoring, the incentive is to create many smaller farms and score the cities multiple times.

Respuesta 19:
Playing base game with inns and cathedrals added in, I can say that farms are not that huge to even considercmuscling your way in any given field. In the last 5 games as 3 or 4 players I don't remember any given field scoring more than 15 points at the end of the game. In these circumstances, I really think farms are overvalued when playing with expansions added in.

Respuesta 20:
The "farm dilemma" is not so important in lower player count games. In high player count games (5-6P), where you only get 11-14 moves instead of 23-24 or 17-18, farms do have a big payoff.

Throw in a few expansions to add more tiles and gizmos and the farms will fall by the wayside, as there will be more opportunity for acquiring points elsewhere. Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders are the top two choices for this.

And smart players will NOT play into the hands of a single farmer. It really isn't that difficult to cut off a farm and it often players right into your own interests. I try to keep MY cities on the opposite side of a wide road from an early farmer - in my games the first farm usually only scores about 9 points. That's not a very good return for losing a meeple the whole game!

Respuesta 21:
My mum when playing always puts a farmer down on the first tile which is kind of annoying but it doesn't always mean that she wins. I usually wait until there are a couple of tiles left and then steal the farm or alternately just keep completing so many extra features with my extra meeples that i am too far ahead in points.

Adding in the expansions such as tower and dragon also really helps stop early farmers from dominating.

After playing a lot of games with the river I have noticed that a giant farm is pretty common despite the roads that cross the river.



Tema 23: Farming Uber powered?
Pregunta:
I've been playing Carcassonne for a couple of years now - and I would consider myself reasonably good at it. Now I don't know if its that I have been playing mainly with the same people this time, or if that the farming rules have changed or what, but we seem to be mainly concentrating on farming. Now that we use barns - almost exclusively. We end up having allour meeple on farms by the end of the game and not even worrying about cities and roads that just seem to not give us the points that we can get by farming. In fact most of the cities end up being very small as we concentrate simply on adding 3 points to each farm by building 2 and three tile cities.
Question is, do you think we are playing this in the wrond way? It is very hard once one person starts bulk farming to counter it because the opponents need to get some farming points too or face annihilation at the end of the game.

Also, what do you see as some good strategies to counter one person pumping a lot of meeple into farms early on (other than the obvious trying to steal their farms, which just starts the whole viscious cycle again)?

Respuesta 1:
First, some assumptions. I'm assuming you're playing by the currently accepted "International" rules (4 points for 2-tile cities, score farms by the farm, not by the city). If you're not, then my advice is void, but also, you should really try them. I'm also assuming you're playing two players. (With more than two players Carc becomes a social game only IMHO and it's much harder to follow any sort of strategy that doesn't include meta-gaming). Finally I'm assuming the main game with no expansions. I'm not sure how it holds up with barns (or Barnes for that matter).

If he starts farming early, don't try to compete with him, instead do the following:

- Farming ties up his meeples for the entire game. To make it hurt worse, look for opportunities to trap more of his meeples. If he has 3-4 meeples on farms, and you trap even one more, you've given yourself a huge advantage.

- Start your cities outside his farms.

- Play roads strategically to encircle his farmers or otherwise cut them off from cities. Be especially wary of where you play the single-road cloisters.

- Build big cities. Aside from reducing his farmer scoring (by having one big city instead of several small ones), he likely won't have enough meeples to contest your presence in the big city. You should still go for the easy small cities, provided they're outside his farms. (It should be obvious that scoring a 4-point city that gives him 3-points isn't a good use of your turn).

- Connect his adjacent farms for him. If he has two separate but adjacent farms, try to connect them. All of the cities those two farms have in common now only score once instead of twice.

- Finally, at the end of the game (last 15 or so total tiles) start looking for cheap farmer points. You can usually easily grab 6-point farms with your remaining meeples.

Hope that helps.

Thanks for the tips HappyProle. Especially the tip of trying to join up his farmers. We all often end up with quite a few farmers vieing, so joing his would be joining mine - unless I decided to concentrate on other areas. A bit of a double edged sword methinks but definitely worth a shot.

we play with the tiles from the expansions, Inns, Princess, River I & II, Builders, and Abbey. generally we only play with the rules of Abbey and Mayor, and Inns and cathedrals.

Usually we are three people (sometimes two or four) and yes we play with the new, standard, farming rules.

What kind of scores are you getting?

We play with a full tower of tiles, but only use the basic rules, plus Cathedrals, lake roads and the big meeple for scoring.

Our game tonight had three people over 250 and one person just under 200. By the end of the game, about 80% of our meeples were in fields, but at least half of that number started farming in the last 5-6 rounds around the table. When we get that close to the end, it's either finish something big or grab a 1-3 city field. The bulk of our points come from cities, roads and cloisters built during the game.... and frequently stolen from other players!

That's not to say that some folks don't start farming early. I placed my first farmer on the river. At the end of the game, he got me 27 points.

We tried the new wooden pieces from Abbey and Mayor a few times, then packed them away. We felt that they trivialized our "stealing" skills and inflated scores without adding anything to the game. Granted, it takes a certain skill to properly time the use of those new pieces, but the subtlety and finesse in breaking in to a field, a city or a long lake road was being pushed to the background.



Tema 24: Can someone explain to me why 2 player Carcassone is considered cutthroat?
Pregunta:
I played it with 4+ and also with 2 and it seems to me 2 is very boring. I saw numerous posts on the game's forum saying that it can be considered cutthroat but was unable to provide any specific reasons WHY.

We tried it with the 3-tiles owned by a player at each time (draw 1 new one everytime you play one). Seems to me it still ended up being that we would try to close off a city tile if we could (enemy had a meeple on it) so they wouldn't score much. Or we would both just build in the same city (pointless for scoring).

Am I missing something? Posting it in general to generate a response hopefully. Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
Don't forget that you can "steal" a city by having more meeples in it. Same for roads and fields. Those mini wars for ownership can be a big deal.

I think that the biggest reason that 2-player is so cutthroat is that it's much easier to plan ahead and respond to your opponent. There is only one opponent, so fewer things happen between your last turn and your next turn -- a big problem when you play with 5 or more players. You can focus entirely on the one other player, and not split your attention.

Similarly, with more players, you can sometimes count on your opponents to help you a bit (cut off other people, etc.). With two players, that just doesn't happen.

You have described the very reason why it is so very cutthroat. By the time your half way through the game, your ready to cut your own throat to get it to end!

Respuesta 3:
Don't complete your opponent's cities for them, it's just giving them points. Instead, make it more difficult for them to complete their cities by playing tiles with roads leading to where they want to place tiles.

Building the same city isn't pointless. If someone spent five turns building up a city and you spend two turns getting one of your meeples into the city, you just negated their points from the city and screwed them out of three turns.

Respuesta 4:
Place tiles so that:

-- your opponent's meeples can never be retrieved from the board

-- your opponent's cities can not be closed

-- you add your meeples to your opponent's large scoring features, thus negating or removing their scoring value

Much of the above requires knowing the tile distribution of the game well and playing the distribution probabilities. Tile distribution sheets for the bas game and various expansions are avilable under their game listings. I provide printed copies of the tile distribution and whatever expansions are in use when playing Carcassonne.

"Steal" cities...you mean put 2 meeples vs their 1? Don't you only have 7 meeples though...

I guess I haven't played it enough to know how to prevent a city from being closed effectively except using the pieces with the roads in them too.

Where is this tile list?

Respuesta 6:
@MrMiyagi

Yes, put more meeples in it than them. Of course, you can't put a meeple into a city which already has a meeple in it, but you can place a meeple in a disconnected city piece and then work to connect it to the larger city.

You only have 7 meeples, but you get the meeples back when you close a city. It's often worth the investment.

@MrMiyagi
I guess I haven't played it enough to know how to prevent a city from being closed effectively except using the pieces with the roads in them too.
Road pieces are useful to make it impossible to place a piece to properly close a city. Also, play large city pieces which require many other tiles to close off (such as the 4-sided city piece) -- that will require many moves, and the right pieces, to close off.

Another way to do that is to completely surround an empty space, attached to a city, with other pieces, such that there is no piece which will fill the hole. It helps to know what pieces there are. For example, the base Carcassonne game does not have any pieces with a city on two opposite sides and a road on the other two opposite sides. If you can arrange it so that your opponent needs that piece, and only that piece, to close off a city, then you have guaranteed that their meeples are forever lost!

@MrMiyagi
Where is this tile list?
It's a single sheet included with the game. Each expansion also has a list of additional tiles.

Yes, Pieces with roads in them are the easiest way. There's a few pieces that don't exist in the base game, and they all involve at least one road and one city.With tile counting there's other ways to make features unfinishable. Maybe all the tiles of that shape are already out. Maybe there's only one left, so there's a 50% chance that you'll be the one getting it. Even if there's more tiles left, tying down your opponent's meeples for a while is still advantageous.

As you add expansions, you also add more exotic tiles to the mix, making the game less cut throat IMO: there's almost always a way out once you have 3 expansions in there.

Respuesta 9:
@MrMiyagi
Uh have I been playing the game completely wrong? You get meeples BACK when you close a city or if all possible roads in an intersection meeple are closed?
Yes -- whenever a city is completely closed, or whenever both ends of a road are closed, everyone with meeples on that city or road get all of their meeples back. Only meeples placed in a field (or on a city/road which is never completed) never come back to you.

Also, with roads: you place meeples on roads, not intersections. So, every road has exactly two ends, no more, no less. The tiles with roads going off in 3 or 4 directions which all meet in the middle, actually have 3 or 4 separate roads. One meeple can't sit on all of them at once!

Your games must have gotten very boring with only 7 meeples and none coming back to you!

[Edit: OK, so it's possible to make a road with 0 ends -- a circular road. But that's a rather special case. It still has to be closed off.]

Respuesta 10:
And as I recall, it is more the stranding other people's meeples, (by making it a low probability that they will get a tile they need to "fit"), than stealing that makes 2 player carc nasty. As in, if you play on BSW, you will find that the majority of your opponent's plays will not have anything to do with scoring points, but rather, just to screw up your placements, freezing your meeples, letting them run roughshod over you at the end of the game.

And having a hand of tiles is lamesauce. Draw a tile. Play it. Meeple it or not.

Respuesta 11:
Multi-player (3+) Carcassonne rewards cooperation -- if you and I are tied for control of a city (for example), I receive just as many points as I would if I alone had control. So, if we both contribute to building that city, we gain more points (against the other players) than if we did so on our own. The key to this is that we are competing *against the other players*. While it's not a guarantee, you have a greater chance of winning if you cooperate with others than if you compete with them. With this in mind, when faced with a "cooperating" move or a "competing" move, the former is often the better choice.

This falls apart when playing two-player since cooperation becomes moot. There's no longer the choice between "cooperating" and "competing" moves and hence the game becomes more cut-throat.

There are some pretty devilish moves to be made once you are familiar with the tile list (or at least their general quantity and make up, i.e. no road/city/road/city or road/city/grass/grass tile in the base game). Give it some time and let your group familiarize themselves with the tiles (and rules! :p), and then I think you'll really start to see it shine. I for one know it surprised the heck out of me. It seems like such a peaceful, simple game!

Respuesta 14:
If you want to encourage players to think about stealing, play without farmers for a game or two. In that case, stealing cities becomes a much bigger deal, because you have less to focus on.

I've seen this happen with my friends -- they learn to go for the throat, and then it carries on into the full game.

Respuesta 15:
It's not unique to Carcassonne, it can be generalized to a lot of games that can play with 2 or 3+ players. In a two player game, denying an opponent N points, or gaining N points, are equally appetizing alternatives. Either way you narrow the margin between you by the same amount.

As a game gains more players, the same choice (gain N points or deny a single opponent N points) becomes much more of a losing proposition, Making a play that doesn't help *you* but hinders player A is ineffective because it doesn't hinder player B (and C and D...).


In Carcassonne, it's easy to deny a single opponent points. In a 2er game, that's every bit as good as scoring those points yourself. In a 3er+ game, your goal should be to fend off everyone - generally, you'd need to deny EVERYONE ELSE N points (each!) for it to be worth foregoing an opportunity to simply gain N points for yourself. And that's not a frequent opportunity - rarely will you have a play that hinders all of your opponents. So rarely is it worth spending your turn to prevent a single opponent from scoring (really, only if you and that player are the breakaway leaders is that a good use of your turn).

No, this is misleading. What you need is simpler:

- A sense for which tiles simply don't exist. You can learn that with just a few plays.

- A sense of how many tiles of each type there are. I only remember a few things. There are 5 or 6 of the very common tiles, and only one 4-sided city. Count tiles of the same type on the board like this: 1, 2, 3, many, lots. If you get to "lots", then the probability of getting another one is low.

Tema 25: Odd number of tiles
Pregunta:
Since 71 is a prime number and this is the number of placeable tiles, the starting player seems to have an advantage. We played a 4 player game last night, and player 4 got to place one less tile than everyone else.

Has anyone ever reduced the base number of tiles by the number of players minus one to ensure that everyoneone gets to play the same number of tiles?

Respuesta 1:
I don't know that it's worth it. For one, number of turns is not a reflection of how well you score. If this were truly a disadvantage, the last player would always come in last. For another, most people play with Expansions and that scews your number as well.

But if you feel it's important, randomly draw the tiles and set them aside. The result will probably be more interesting with certain tiles missing than it will be giving everyone equal turns.

Respuesta 2:
We recognised this anomaly when we bought the game, but it has never bothered us. The key to this game is the placement of meeples, not the placement of tiles, and everyone gets the same number of meeples. It seems to me that success depends on how well you can deploy, recover and re-use your stock of meeples.

Accepted that the player who gets an extra turn might be able to re-use one meeple one time more than everyone else, but it shouldn't be worth more than a couple of additional points unless that player is very fortunate indeed.

If the player with an extra turn hasn't got a meeple in hand, the question is how much can an existing score be added to by placing the tile. I don't recall ever seeing a city of over two or three tiles in size being successfully closed off with the final tile played, or a long road being terminated, but I suppose it might happen from time to time. In our group, if there was a large city still open near the end of the game, then another player would either muscle in to share the score or would play a tile to ensure it needed at least a couple to enable it to be closed, but in fact we're usually too busy trying to smuggle farmers into each other's fields in the later stages by extending fields around corners!

If it does bother you, then reduce the stock of tiles to the next highest number that is exactly divisible by the number of players.

Respuesta 3:
See it this way: the starting player is the first do add tiles to the layout and has therefore fewer options than a player who plays later.

Respuesta 4:
Our group decided early on to deem the starting tile to be the first player's automatic placement, said player being thus allowed to place a meeple on it if he/she so desires. With the exception of five-player games, this evens out the tile distribution for most permutations of the game and its various expansions.

Respuesta 5:
We play the base game + 1 for our lunchtime games, to even out the number of turns. The +1 is the CCCF piece that has three distinct cities. Yes, Meeple placement is important, but that doesn't mean that number of tiles drawn is unimportant. Now, we just need a house rule to re-even it out after an unplayable tile is drawn (even as the last tile)...

Respuesta 6:
The way we play it here, all River tiles are mixed up and after both ends are drawn and placed, the rest get tossed. Thusly, the number of remaining tiles is never known when the first player is determined. The rest is just luck. The rare unplayable tile does keep it from being completely pre-determined. I don't think it has ever caused an upset to balance--especially when you add many, many more tiles from additional sets.

And this is just a welcome side-effect to the great reasons for playing The River this way.

Now throw in the Builder and mess up your well-laid balancing plans.

Respuesta 7:
We have been playing like that for a while, yes. Essentially, we used the basic set plus the expansion, along with a very small expansion that I don't remember even where it came from. We simply removed some bits that we thought were redundant (for instance, if the small expansion added a cloister on a t-junction, we removed a normal t-junction so as to preserve the same balance for road-building, but adding the new tile).

Also, we divide the tiles beforehand into equally big stacks and each player gets his own. That makes it a lot easier to keep track of how many tiles there are left and so forth.

I think there is a point in playing the same number of tiles, but it's not a very big one. There are too many other factors that matter and this is simply not extremely important. However, if you find extra tiles you feel you want to add to your game, you might as well choose a number that matches the number of players.

You can't do that. If a tile is drawn that can't be played, it gets thrown out of the game, messing up the even number you just created.

If you want to try that approach, just remember who the start player is, then stop the game when there aren't enough tiles to go a complete round.



Tema 26: Carcassonne - Road Strategies
Pregunta:
For my Strategies , I will give each Meeple (your little wooden follower figures) Mission (an objective to score points) a ratio that determines how many points you will get per tile/turn used per Meeple required to complete the Mission to help you weigh your strategy options. The more points you get, obviously the better. The more tiles required to get higher points, the more turns/tiles you've wasted on a low value mission, thus less of an important Mission and possibly a waste of time. The more Meeples required to complete the Mission, the less Meeples you have to devote to other Missions.

I will also try to provide Counter-Strategies for each Mission Scenario. Unfortunately, I do not own all of the Expansions, and can therefore only account for those that I have played. I will update this if I should happen to acquire them, or come across sufficient information to write about.

Road Mission - To have a Meeple on a length of Road. Extend the road to the optimum amount of tiles. Cap all ends of the Road so that points may be scored and to have your Meeple returned to your inventory.




With the Basic Edition of Carcassonne, the Roads only score 1 point per tile whether they are finished or not.

Roads: Intro

The Ratio of Points per Tile per Meeple for any given Road Mission is 1:'X':1

This means the more tiles(x) you devote to your road with a Meeple on it, the more points you get. However, you do not get your Meeple back unless the road is completed. Therefore you must be able to afford to not have a Meeple for a given period of time, if not the entire game.
So if you have a road with 7 tiles (x=7), then you have gotten 7x1=7points from the 1 Meeple you have spent on the Road Mission.

If someone is trying to steal/share your road, think about how many tiles long the road currently is, and how many Meeples you have devoted to this road, if the road is only 5 tiles long, then it is only worth 5 points and is probably not worth spending extra Meeples. There is not much strategy to using the roads in the basic edition, other than grab them while they're long, but don't waste too many Meeples on them.

Strategy: The "Quick-Points" Approach
This is a very simple strategy that can be used by anyone. The key is to keep your eye open, and a spare Meeple in your inventory. Sometimes when you play, you may notice that you get a lot of road end-pieces in a row and that you do not have much use for them. On the contrary, every time a road is finished on both ends, you score points, and get your Meeple back. So if you keep placing end-pieces next to each-other, you can keep placing your Meeple down for a quick 2-points or so, and then return your Meeple back to your inventory for the next opportunity. 2-points may not sound like much, but it adds up if done repeatedly. Remember, some times you only need those 2 more points to win or tie a game. So get 'em while they're available.

Counter-Strategy: The "Boxed-In" Approach
For the Basic Edition, there are not many effective counter strategies, as they will score points whether or not the Mission is complete. However, By placing tiles near and around the ends of their roads, thus "Boxing-them-In," that create a limited number of options to continue extending the road, not only limit and prevent the completion of the Road Mission, but also limit its maximum potential length and point value, and tie up an opponent's Meeple for the rest of the game leaving them shorthanded with only a handful of points to show for it. This creates the dreaded unfillable "Hole."




With the River & River II Expansions, many road tiles will be laid down for you within close proximity to each-other as a result of them being part of the River tiles.

The Ratio of Points per Tile per Meeple for aany given Road Mission is 1:'X':1

Strategy: Connect the Roads
Do not place your Meeple on a road tile during the river-laying portion of the game, as you do not know where the majority of tiles will be played, and you do not want to base your entire strategy on completing roads because their point value is not very high (see intro above). This is done best in a corner river piece, where the two adjacent river pieces both have roads, thereby getting a 3-tile road, by only laying 1 road tile. This works even better when one or both of these adjacent river pieces are the cloister/road/river-tiles so that they also cap off one end of the road making it easier to complete the other end.

Counter-Strategy: The "Boxed-In" Approach (see above)




With the Inns & Cathedrals Expansion, the Roads could also possibly score 0 points if your Road has an Inn on it and the Mission is not completed by the end of the game, or 2 points per tile if an Inn is located on the Road and you do complete the Road Mission.

The Ratio of Points per Tile per Meeple for any given Road Mission is 0/1/2:'X':1

The strategy for a Normal Road (without an Inn) is almost the same as in the Basic Edition, however, be wary that towards the end of the game, someone may try to add an Inn to your Road if they believe there are no more end pieces left to draw. While this may happen, if it happens towards the end of the game, do not feel disheartened, for your Meeple has probably scored you all the points it will for this game, and would not do you any good by returning to your inventory. Consider the fact that you have forced your opponent to waste a tile/turn in order to counter your Road Mission.

Strategy: The "Single Strand" Approach
If they use the counter-strategy listed above, then you very well may have lost your Meeple for the rest of the game with no points to show for it. The best way to avoid having your Road "Boxed-In" is to create a "Single-Strand" Road that leaves the playing area, rather than one that winds within.

Strategy: Romans used Slaves to build Roads
The Inns & Cathedrals Expansion also comes with a Big Meeple that is worth 2 Meeples. If someone else is going to all the trouble of building a big long road, why not take their hard work road laying. Rome had slaves build roads so that Romans could walk on them. Consider your Big Meeple a Roman, and their tiny Meeple a Slave. At whatever point works best for you, place a road tile with your Roman on it, in a way that would make it easy for you to connect your road tile to their road with the addition of only one more road tile. Once you have connected the Roman road tile to the Slave road, you will then own the road, and when it is scored, only you will aquire points. If playing with more than 2 people, this also works by playing a "Slave" Meeple instead of a Roman. You and your opponent will then each get an equal amount of points, but you will both be gaining points on your other opponents who are not on the road.

Counter-Strategy: Slaves go Union
If you are faced with the above Roman Praetorian about to take over your road, you can either unionize your slaves by doing the exact same thing they just did, and over-power them again, or you can pray for an intersection piece that will split the roads and allow you to keep what you've worked so hard to build.

Counter-Strategy: HELP! My Meeple got lost and spent the rest of the game at an Inn!
Someone has created a long "Single-Strand" Road, it's almost the end of the game, and it looks like your opponent is about to score some points that could affect the outcome of the game. With few tiles left, you draw a road piece with an Inn on it. Not much good it will due you unless you are lucky enough to find a road end-piece or 2 to finish your own road. Chances are your opponent is not that lucky either. Put that Inn-road tile on their road. If they are lucky enough to complete it they will get double points, but if they don't they will get zero, and their Meeple will waste their last turns sleeping at the Inn. Chances are they will spend the rest of the game hoping and praying for those road end-pieces and will not get them because they were already used.




With the Abbey & Mayor Expansion, more intersection and end pieces are provided, some "unique situation" pieces are provided to help prevent from getting "Boxed-In," and a new Abbey piece is provided to counter the dreaded unfillable "Hole." There is also a Wagon Meeple to make Road scoring easier and more dedicated.

The Ratio of Points per Tile per Meeple for aany given Road Mission is 1:'X':1

Strategy: The Dedicated Traveler
As soon as Rio Grande Games added the Wagon to this expansion, they gave you a clue. One Meeple is about all you should devote to scoring road points. Thus born was the Wagon . If you were hesitant about using Meeples on roads for fear of not having enough when you needed them, fear not, for the Wagon has arrived. Use the wagon solely for roads (though they may once in a while help you score some points in cities). Not only does this let you save your Meeples for more important tasks, but it allows you to move to other unfinished roads without having to place a tile on it. Once you score points with your wagon, you may move it to a connected road or city that is currently unfinished, even if you didn't lay that tile down. It practically does the work for you. There is also a new 3-way road piece to make roads potentially much longer, but much harder to finish.

Counter-Strategy: This Road doesn't lead to Rome
To counter the wagon, cap off their road with a road end-piece that doesn't have other road starting points on it. Though you may wonder why I would suggest that you would cap off someone else's road, there are other strategies involved at that point besides roads. There are times when it is a reasonable choice.

Counter-Counter-Strategy: I found some dirt to fill in this "Hole"
If someone has used the "Boxed-In" counter-strategy to prevent you from scoring points and gave you the dreaded "hole", the Abbey has just saved you . Though each player only gets one, it is far better than having to hope you randomly draw one. Therefore, use it wisely. Chances are, you will save it for a city that is 1 tile away from being completed, but there are occaisions where a high value Inn-Road will merit its use. As long as there is a "hole" with a tile on each of the 4 adjacent sides, the Abbey is legal to play, and will cap your road. Not to mention, it also counts as a cloister, and can give you up to 9 points if finished with a Monk Meeple on it.



Indirect Uses

Strategy: Socialist & Corporate Farming
Roads can be used for more than just scoring points. One great use is to connect your farms to more cities and expand their size and count more points. This also works to share or steal opponent's farm land by connecting your farm to theirs. If you have multiple farmers and then connect them both to an opponent's farm, you have just out numbered their farmer and have stolen all farm points, as well as left is farmer on the playing field, useless for the rest of the game. If you have the Inns & Cathedrals Expansion, you can use your "Roman" Meeple to outnumber their farmers even faster. If you have the Abbey & Mayor Expansion, you can use roads to create a place for your barn, or to connect other farmers to your barn. If you're really good, you can even connect 2 barns together. A new road end piece has been added that ends in the middle of the tile. Also good pieces are cloisters that end roads to prevent road blocks from other farms.

Counter-Strategy: Independent Family Farming
In the same way that roads were used as a farming strategy, they can be used as a counter-strategy to block competing citizen farmers, and invading corporate barns to ensure that you are the only one getting points for those cities. 3-way & 4-way intersections are the best ways to cut off competing farmers.



Tema 27: Let your friends do the work, just make sure you get credit
Pregunta:
At first glance Carcassonne appears to be about using the tiles you draw throughout the game to start features with your meeples on them and then to complete and score those features for points. Don’t be fooled. In fact this is not what this game is about! It’s about scoring the most points. I suppose you can (and should) score points SOME points by building and completing features with your meeples on them but I recommend you also consider getting points by spending your time getting your meeples into the features your friends are building.

Why? Its fun to take credit for others hard work! But wait, there’s more:

Consider this hypothetical. It’s a 3 player game and during the game players A, B, and C each drew exactly 12 tiles with city on them and each built themselves a single twelve tile city. Assuming no penants, each player has built a city worth 24 points so these tiles are a wash … all players got equal points so the game will be decided by what the players did with their other tiles drawn throughout the game.

Now take that same scenario but instead of building her own city player C used her 12 city tiles to get one of her meeples into each of the other two cities. Say she used 6 tiles to get her meeple into player A’s city to share it and the other 6 to get into and share player B’s city. Now there are two cities each with 18 tiles. Player A has 36 points, player B has 36 points, and player C has 72 points (since she tied for majority in both of the cities). Stealing either or both cities by getting majority would have been even better but player C has still gotten a great advantage just by ‘sharing’.

So remember kids, ‘Share’ with your friends or steal from them, either way is fine as long as they do most of the work. When your friend starts a feature and doesn’t close if off promptly, consider it an invite for your meeples to visit.

PS> Much like stealing candy from a baby, stealing from some opponents is just too easy. When playing with Grandma, noobs, or young children, consider limiting yourself to ‘Sharing’ tactics at first (no stealing) to keep it closer, more challenging for you, and more fun for them. Soon they will try to steal from you … then the gloves are off (sorry Grandma).



Tema 28: A Guide to Carcassonne strategy: The basics
Pregunta:
Hello,

I have published a fairly ambitious guide to the basic concepts of Carcassonne strategy. It is most relevant for the basic set plus The Expansion, but most of what I say is pertinent for Carcassonne in general (to any game, in some cases). Since my website is not ideal for discussions, I post here and hope that someone will benefit from my article. It can be found here:

A guide to Carcassonne strategy: The basics

All the very best,

Olle

Respuesta 1:
Nice job Olle,
I was pleased to see we use a lot of the techniques you mentioned. I especially like the cooperative strategy. That really seems to be a game winner for those who can play that way.

Respuesta 2:
That's a thumbs up from me
Carcassonne is probably the favourite game in this household, we used to play nice and easy until my brother-in-law showed us how effective a "robber baron" style of gaming can be.

The sharing thing we call invasion, it can make or break a game, especially a two player game when the weaker player is desperately trying to catch up with a mega-city. I lost the prettiest city I ever played that way, it had a kind of lolipop shape with an island in the middle.

The cathedrals in our matches tend to be "armas arrojadizas", that is to say, heavy artillery. It's a dangerous strategy but works well late in the game. We also use the riverside inns towards the end of the game to try and neutralize opponents points.

Another thing we generally try to do (playing with the river expansion of course) is to try and gage the likelihood of city rich areas and plant an early farmer, towards the end of the game we try to plant a second farmer to outnumber any "agricultural invaders". We don't actually use the little-john follower to play, house rules, we just bung them onto the scoring card.

I've got to say (and it has probably been said before, but I'm a relatively new geek) is that what we most enjoy about carcassonne is that every expansion dramaticly alters game-play. I think we have them all except the princess and the dragon, my moon-silver lady won't let me get that one untill we've mastered all the previous expansions, but I just gotta (sic) get that wooden dragon.

Respuesta 3:
First, glad you liked the article. As I mentioned, playing the fields is probably the most difficult aspect of the game. We generally tend to play on field fairly late, but since it is fairly common for big fields (around sever or eight towns, perhaps), bitter wars are fought over them towards the end. Although it is rare, we have had several games with five (yes, five) followers on one and the same field from one and the same player. This happens when two players base their entire strategy on winning that big field and it it remains open the whole game.

So, playing on fields early on is very rare, except for those games when the... uh... tile with four (or three) separate towns is drawn early and creates a potentially big field right from the very start. Generally speaking, playing on a field too early is not worth much, since your opponents can catch up pretty easily if they want to. Closed or nearly closed fields is of course something entirely different. Sometimes it is possible to gain three town alone fairly early in the game, but it is not very common.

Respuesta 4:
This is the best Carcassonne strategy guide I've seen on this site. You hit on several important points, especially with farming and meeple management. I see the sense behind your theory of relativity; that'll help me tons from now on.

Respuesta 5:
As for basic strategy, I might add some comment about using tiles that appear useless. Often, when players get a tile they can't use to get points, they just dump in somewhere fairly random, or add it to some road they've been working on (giving them only one extra point). Sometimes the best use of a tile is to make other players features harder to complete. Especially in the two player game, where you won't be placing followers as commonly, it's often a good idea to play "mean" and injure your opponent's position rather than marginally help yourself.

Respuesta 6:
Adres: You are of course perfectly right. It is very uncommon that tiles are truly useless. Even if one cannot use a tile to disrupt someone else's play, one might still use it to set up a situation which might lead to someone else being trapped, i.e. one plays the tile so as to enable the next player to trap the third or fourth player. Apparently useless tiles can also be used to modify the structure of a field by making it more open or more closed, depending on which one wants.

Respuesta 7:
This is tip-worthy, fellow Carcassonne fans.

Respuesta 8:
This seems to be extremely well written, but I stopped reading after a short time since one of the joys of gaming is developing my own strategies.

Besides, I already win more than my share with the strategies I have developed thus far.


My hat is off to the author, but this isn't for me. :-) I might send it to my opponents to level the playing field though.

---tom

Respuesta 9:
This is an excellent article and I've learned a lot. Especially the idea that when down on a project to all 4 opponents, helping one take over the project nets you all the points vs. the other 3 -- that hadn't occurred to me.

Still, I'm not sure I would follow that strategy if I were guaranteed to lose to that one player anyway. This is obviously a style preference, but if it looks impossible to come in 1st place, I don't prefer 2nd to 3rd. Rather, I tend to become a loose cannon (kingmaker) and threaten to aid another player to win in hopes of attaining gains from the lead player. Usually it doesn't work. But maybe I should play your way so as to continue getting practice at the same strategy which could be used in other games to win.

Enjoyed it!

Tema 29: builder strategy
Pregunta:
KEEP THE BUILDER IN PLAY
Try to have your builder in play as much as possible. If you can have your builder active for most of the game and your opponent's builder is trapped or out of play for most of it - this alone will probably win you the game by the sheer majority of tiles you will pull. Extra tiles for you means fewer tiles for your opponent. Extra tiles for you also means increased probability of drawing those certain tiles you need.

DON'T PLACE YOUR BUILDER WHERE IT WILL GET TRAPPED
Note that by "trapped," I don't necessarily mean being in a feature that cannot be finished easily. This in itself is not that bad. The bad thing is having your builder in a feature that cannot be *added to*. That said, don't place your builder where it will get trapped easily. Place it on a feature that has a lot of tiles out at the edge of the map, with a lot of open edges that can receive a wide variety of new tiles.

DON'T PRIORITIZE FINISHING THE BUILDER'S FEATURE
After you place your builder on a feature, don't prioritize finishing that feature. Instead, prioritize keeping that feature open and expandable. This will not only maximize the tiles that you are able to place on the feature (earning you those critical bonus tiles), but will also make it harder for your opponent to close off the feature and trap your builder. Even if you never finish that city, it will at least serve as a reliable vehicle for bonus tiles. If you can avoid the cathedral, that large unfinished city will still net some nice points even at the paltry end-game rate.

WHEN YOU DO FINISH A BUILDER FEATURE
Sometimes it will become convient/desireable to finish a feature with a builder. Try to do it on the first tile of your turn - not your bonus tile. Do this in conjunction with having another suitable place to put the builder. That way, on your bonus turn you can place the builder again and it will never be out of play. When it looks like you may finish the builder's feature, you should also be thinking about where the builder will go next. If you are about to finish the feature on your bonus turn and you have nowhere else to place the builder - consider placing that tile somewhere else.

THE BUILDER AND THE TOWER
An active builder gives the player a certain special advantage when using The Tower expansion. In one turn you can capture an opponent's meeple 2 spaces away from an empty tower foundation (or 2 spaces away from a tower that needs 2 more pieces). Similarly, if you draw a tower tile on your first turn, you can then capture an opponent meeple 1 space away on your bonus turn. When using the builder with The Tower, never forget about this tactic. Never forget that your opponent may also use it against you.



Tema 30: basic set strategy
Pregunta:
Some thoughts on the game using the basic set which is all we used in a tournament i played in.
All ideas are for two players and will possible repeat what is already
written in other strategy threads.

CITIES.

small 4 pts 2 tiles
medium 6-10 3-5
large 12-18 6-9
huge 20+ 10+

Some ideas,

* Build and score alot of medium cities
* Score small cities and if you can farm them they will net you seven points
* Score the odd large city if they arise.
* Stop building shared cities but keep your eye on them for chances to win the majority and steal the points.Be watchful of your opponent doing the same.
Don't get caught up in the skirmish for control of the city at the expense of other points


FARMS.

*I like to place an early farmer to keep up with or hopefully ahead of my opponent.Maybe wait a few tiles to get a feel for how the farm is developing.
*Always look to at least share a farm till towards the end game when meeples returning from cities can be used to take over the farm.Late game placements of roads,cloisters and city tiles with thought on farm expansion and joining can really reap points.



CLOISTERS


*If you draw a couple and place them next to each other they can quickly score.
*You can strand a meeple there for the whole game if you are unlucky
*Mostly used for joining farms.


ROADS

*I always try to have a meeple on a road so that road tiles i draw are not wasted.They also won't provide easy points for my opponent.
*Don't forget that roads can be shared.In a close game the win can come down to a few points and the points you shared on a road can be vital.



HOLES (The 5th feature)

*Place roads ane city segments with thought to the holes you leave around cities you want to keep unfinished.This will limit the tiles that will fit in these holes you create.
*This will leave the opponents meeples trapped in unfinishable cities.Trap meeples in cloisters the same way.
*You can also use this idea to stop an opponent from merging and sharing you city.You can place tiles to make the hole needed to merge you opponents city segment with your city unplayable.Yes,this will also trap your meeple in an unfinishable city,but it ties up your opponents meeple which you will outscore leaving you with a small advantage.
*Holes will also keep farms small,lowering the harvest of points from them.



MEEPLE MANAGEMENT

*Always keep one meeple in hand to score any easy place and score points.these are small cities and neglected roads.
*Every meeple of your opponent you can trap effectively means you are playing with more meeples than them.This reduces their future scoring chances.


GAME PHASES

Early game.

*early farm placement
*longish roads can develop don't neglect them

Mid game.

*develop cities
*invade opponents cities
*consolidate farm control

End game.

*complete cities
*merge and steal farms
*be wary that trying to work your way into opponents cities late in the game may leave your meeple on one city segment scoring only one point at game end.


TIME

The tournament i played in used chess clocks set at 15 minutes each per game,if your time ran out you lost regardless of points scored.
This is a fantastic way to play as the time pressure increases the tension during the game.15 minutes is plenty of time but it adds just enough pressure to make a clock a worthwhile addition to your game cupboard.


I won 2 and lost 2 for the tournament so i still have alot to learn about the game,maybe these ideas are too simple or maybe I have been thinking to much,your comments good or bad would be helpful.

Thanks for your time.

Respuesta 1:
Thanks, there's plenty of helpful advice in your post. I like your point about placing two cloisters next to each other- that's one of my favourites! Cheers.



Tema 31: The Q and Anti-Q pieces
Pregunta:
The only real "gotcha" strategy I've got is to try to trap my opponent into the "anti-Q" situation, where the only piece that will complete his feature is a city at the top with the road going off to the left, a tile I haven't seen yet. Also, the "Q" piece, since there's only one of (with the city at the top and the road going off to the right) is another thing I try to watch out for. They seem to be the easiest to keep track of and the simplest to build a strategy around. One more piece that is useful that way is the city at the top with the road going straight down. I don't have a cute nickname for that one, although "bikini-wax" might fit the bill.

Respuesta 1:
If you're talking about the pieces I think you're talking about, the anti-Q piece is in the King & Scout expansion.

And the straight-road piece looks like a plunger to me.

Respuesta 2:
Indeed you're right. I just found the reference sheets in the file section and looked through them to see if one had been introduced. King and Scout has my "Anti-Q" and Inn and Cathedrals has my "Q" piece. I play on games.asobrain.com a lot, so I generally just see the pieces for the basic game, the expansion and the I&C.

I wish they'd add on the River expansion.

Respuesta 3:

@kevinwho
And the straight-road piece looks like a plunger to me.
It won't anymore

Respuesta 4:
I did a survey of every possible combo along the edges. I don't have the breakdown on this computer. But every possible combo is now available in the game. So while the Q and anti-Q are still rare, there is no was to block any combo until those few pieces are played.

Respuesta 5:
I'm not 100% sure what pieces you are referring to, but I have the new Abbey & Mayor expansion, and it comes with an "Abbey Piece." This piece can essentially be placed next to ANY adjacent tile, as long as it is filling in a "hole" (a hole with 4 tiles on either side). The Abbey Piece counts as a cloister, as well it finishes any road or city that it touches. Each player gets to start with this piece in hand and can play it instead of drawing one, therefore you never have to wait for the piece either. You may have to rethink your strategy upon buying this expansion. I also think this is the best expansion to date.

Respuesta 6:
Umm, I know I am not getting something...

I am looking at the Inns/Cathedral sheet of tiles. There are two tiles, each of them have a city on two edges and a road running out of the city to one edge. They are mirror images of one another. Is this the piece you are talking about? Does it (they) have a city edge on TWO sides? Otherwise I dont get the Q...

THanks. this bothering me.

Respuesta 10:
Well thank you very much for clearing this up I was really getting confused there. Thanks W.

For the sake of completeness I want to add one other thing: you said that to make the anti q piece you "rotate it." YOu cannot rotate it to make a mirror image. YOu need to flip it over and then copy the resulting image. or put it in a mirror. Becuase the q piece has a "handedness" to it, rotating it does not produce it's mirror image. Only a mirror or a flip..

You probably already knew that. BUt thanks again that was really messing with me.



Tema 32: Using cathedrals defensively
Pregunta:
In the last few games of Carcassonne we've played (we have the original rivers expansion as well as Inns & Cathedrals), we've been getting down to the last 1/3 of the tiles before pulling out a cathedral tile. I was dismayed at first because I didn't want to invalidate the points on a city I'd be building, so I got the idea of using the cathedral defensively to stall another player's city. It worked well - stopped him from getting 30+ points.

Bu then we had a somewhat friendly but lively discussion of whether this was legal. I don't see anything in the rules that says it isn't, but I wouldn't recommend trying this against one of those uber-competitive types or against someone who takes such moves against them personally.

Anyone else try this? Any other suggestions on playing Carcassonne defensively?

Respuesta 1:
Oh yes ... without a doubt.

Any Cathedrals I get in the last third of the game go in my opponent's city, and I may even add extra tiles to it to keep it 'open'.

Definitely a legitimate tactic.

Respuesta 2:
They are best used defensively.

Respuesta 3:
Funny how you term the use of cathedrals in this way as "defensive" when in my house, we see it as "offensive." In fact, that's pretty much the only way I play them as I've yet to be able to complete a city that has a cathedral in them. Out of the three of us who regularly play at my place, only one of us ever finishes a cathedral city -- recently, he actually completed one that contained *two* cathedrals in it, for an ungodly [pun intended! ] number of points!

Respuesta 4:
In a two player game, this can be risky strategy even with "only" a third of the tiles left, especially with a builder involved. Be prepared to "invest" some more tiles keeping the city open.

It's certainy legal, though!

But that is exactly the way us competitive types play the game, and we do yet more! We lock up the board so that your meeples can never be retrieved, we lay city tiles to ensure that your cities can never close, we lay roads to cut out your farmers and ensure they can never score more than a handful of cities etc. There are many many such tactics, and this is, to my mind, the best way to play the game.

Respuesta 9:
I have certainly used Cathedrals both offensively and defensively. The fewer number of players - the higher the odds I will try to use the Cathedrals offensively for my own points.

We play with the tiles from all the expansions to date (but not necessarily the rules from all of them).

I have found if you use the cathedral on your own city then it is wise to put the builder on the same city.

Defensively, when I have played the cathedral on my opponent's city I have also glommed on elsewhere with one of my followers just in case the city WAS completed....usually if the opponent places the builder on that city.

It's all about the number of cathedral tiles left and the number of regular city tiles left.

Respuesta 10:
How could that NOT be legal? On my last game on Friday, someone tried to do that to me. I turned it into a 45 point city. Nuts to him.



Tema 33: Carcassonne: 2-Player Strategy
Pregunta:
Here are a few thoughts from playing a fair amount of Carcassonne lately on BSW:

This is mostly for 2-player, Trader & Builder, Inns & Cathedrals + King, but most of it is applicable to the base set as well.

1. Know the tile set
It seems obvious, but knowing what tiles are and aren't in the game (Depending on which expansions you're using) and which tiles are yet to be drawn is crucial to doing well in this game. Even if you don't track all the tiles, it's especially important to at least track some of the very unique tiles (both of the two 1-road elbow into 1-city tiles, the 1-road straight into 1-city tile) to help with tying up meeples (See No. 2).

2. Tie up your opponents meeples when possible
Knowing the tile set can really help you with this one. Getting lots of roads and no city tiles? Did your opponent just play his Uber-Meeple and Builder in the same city? Sometimes with some clever play of otherwise subpar tiles you can tie them up if not indefinitely, for a good part of the game. Even if you're just tying up normal meeples in cloisters, cities or lake-roads, it can translate into a significant points advantage as the game goes on.

3. Know how to "horn in" on a city
If you're attempting to add more meeple strength to a city (your own or an opponent's), keep in mind how many tiles away the meeple is from being connected in. I see a lot of people play meeples in city tiles that are two tiles away from being connected. If you're desperate, this can work, but it is very easily thwarted.

4. Know how to protect your city from "horning in"
This is the converse of Number 3. If possible, build your cities such that you prevent 1-tile-away connections.

5. Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Gigantic cities can be nice, but if you get into an arms race with your opponent over a huge city, she may just get the perfect sequence of tiles to finish it with a majority. If, on the other hand, you have a solid majority in a gigantic city, your opponent may play to make that city unfinishable. Playing your builder and large meeple in a congested city will also be an invitation to your opponent to try to tie them up for the rest of the game. Spread out and diversify!

6. Pay attention to the goods
The Trader goods can score a significant amount of points. The cloth goods are much more rare than the wine, and the grain falls in between. Consider finishing an opponent's city of value eight or less just to get one of the rarer goods, especially if it's likely he'll finish it anyway.

7. Look for farmers near endgame
I would advise against playing early farmers. It's usually so easy for good players to connect into your farms even late in the game that it just isn't worth it committing meeples early for this. Depending on your meeple stock, start looking to heavily play for farms around 30 tiles to go. While farmers are typically inefficient scorers early, they're typically your most efficient point scorers in the final 10 tiles - you can almost always find a way to get at least 6 points per meeple with them.

Respuesta 1:
7.-MOD. Barns
Once you get the Abbey & Mayor Expansion, this strategy practically gets thrown out the window. Play your farmers early, then play your barns later, but before your opponent(s) do.



Tema 34: Carcassonne: The Math
Pregunta:
No, this is not some bizarre new variant. It is a discussion of one aspect of the tactics of play: the value of a tile. So often I see new players making odd choices. They fail to understand the simple math behind the tile placement. For the sake of clarity, I will be ignoring other aspects of strategy. This discussion is for the basic game only. Many of the expansions significantly affect the evaluation of scoring.

The Basics

There are 72 tiles in the basic set. That means each player in a 2-player game will be placing 35 or 36 tiles over the course of the game. In my experience, final scores tend to be in the 100-150 point range. That's an average of 2.8 to 4.3 points per tile played. Do you need to score this much every time you play a tile? No, but there are considerations to maximize profit.

Roads

Roads would seem to be the least favorable play since each tile is only worth 1 point. Even so, new players love to take otherwise useless* road tiles and add them to one of their roads. This practice is often inferior.

In general, roads should be a secondary consideration. However, since roads appear on many tiles and must be connected as tiles are played, there often exists many 2/3/4+ unoccupied but connected road segements. If your meeple situation warrants AND the road(s) are reasonably situated, it is usually better to take advantage of an already created road than to extend one (1 point vs. 3+ points).

You can also get some sneaky points with roads. Consider the following case. You have a meeple at A on the south side of a 4-way intersection.

......... +-------+
+-------+ |...x...|
|...x...| |xBxxxxx|
|xxxxxxx| |...x...|
|...A...| +-------+
+-------+-------+
|...x...|...x...|
|...xxxx|xxxx...|
|.......|.......|
+-------+-------+

Adding the 4th tile and placing a meeple at B completes the road under A for 4 points and scores an additional 2 points for the new road.

Cloisters

These are perhaps the most misunderstood features for new players. Since they are worth 9 points, there is a huge incentive to play and complete them. However, each tile is still only worth 1 point for that cloister. Adding a tile to a cloister is the same as adding a tile to a road. Unless you need the meeple back, or there is some other reason, do not simply add a 1-point tile to a cloister.

The real value of a cloister is in its initial placement. 4 to 6 points is not uncommon. Also, placing a cloister against an opponent's feature means that your opponent will need to help you if they want to complete their own road/city. Also, 2 cloisters side by side allows for 4 of the tiles to be shared. This is still only 2 points per tile, but better than 1.

Always consider the value of a cloister as "in the bank". As yourself what you add specifically by playing the tile. Do not think of it as getting 9 points only when you complete it.

Cities

Cities are the most complicated of scoring issues. They can be worth 1, 2, or 4 points per tile depending on the size of the city and any shield icons present. Also, cities give points to farmers.

Unless you are trying to score farmer points, avoid making 2-point cities. Also, rather than starting a city for yourself each time, favor extending an existing unoccupied city cap with a non-cap piece.

If you have 2 or more incomplete cities, favor placing new city tiles onto the largest of them. This way you will more likely finish the larger cities, leaving the potentially incomplete smaller ones for the end game scoring.

If you have the option of extending a city or starting a new one by extending an unoccupied city tile, opt for the latter if you can spare the meeple. This is worth 4 points instead of 2.

Fields

Fields are very straight forward, but because their total value is accumulated until the end, they create an ever increasing tension as the game draws to an end. In addition, players incorrectly feel the need to attack opponents who have large fields.

Here's an example. Player A has a farmer (A) in a field with 5 cities (C):

....A....
.........
C-C-C-C-C

This is worth 15 points (new farmer scoring). Player B wants to attack this field. To do so, he must play a tile/farmer, then later play another tile that connects the field. This means he must play 2 tiles AND take the risk that he'll even be ABLE to connect. Why not do this:

....A....
.........
C-C-C-C-C
.........
....B....

It's a single tile, it's no risk, and it still grabs all 15 points.

A related example. This time not all the cities are on the same border of the field:

..C...C..
.........
....A....
.........
C---C---C

Player A still has 15 points. Again Player B could attack this field with the same 2 tiles and risk. Player B could also play the same way as in the previous example:

..C...C..
.........
....A....
.........
C---C---C
.........
....B....

Player B gets 9 points to A's 15. This is particularly good near the end game.

Cities + Fields

If you already have a field that you think you can keep control of, then the creation of cities changes quite a bit. Forming a 2 point city nets you 5 points overall. That's 2.5 points per tile. Using the "double cap" tiles to complete an existing city AND start a new one at the same time can earn you 10 points for 3 tiles.

In Summary

Always ask yourself how many real points you are adding to your score, counting just the tile being played. This will help you evaluate your options when you add in all the other factors that occur in the game. If you find yourself simply adding to a feature you already control, you may want to think again.


* I would assert that almost no tile is useless. If you can't directly help yourself, you can either indirectly prepare for some future opportunity, or attack an opponent by trying to negate/steal/block a feature.

Respuesta 1:
This all seems awfully simplistic. Much of the game is about managing your limited supply of meeples, so, e.g., the (obvious) point that you can often score 2 or 3 points by putting out a new robber, as opposed to 1 point for extending an existing road, really misses the point of the play which is to avoid using up your meeples. Similarly, finishing cloisters gets the meeple back to be reused, so the play of a tile next to a cloister is worth more than 1 point: it's worth 1 point plus a fraction of the value of the reclaimed meeple. Etc.

I found this to be a useful analysis. Of course, you need to consider other factors in the game, taking over other cities, etc. But, when you weigh those other options against the "value" of a tile, I can see how it would help you a lot. This analysis simply helps you condense a lot of aspects of the game into a central concept. Nicely done.

Actually NO. There are "84 Land Tiles" according to the basic set box that I am holding in my hand. I don't know what game you're playing. Normally such an error would not be worth my effort of noting, but considering that your strategy is completely based on math, I think it is of significant importance considering the extra 6 turns each player would have in a 2-player game.

I don't want to completely knock your post though, so I must say, good-job at noting:

Quote:

That is probably the greatest lesson/strategy to be learned for this game.

I also completely agree with how you should evaluate your points/per tile played. I should start tracking my game scores and averaging them over how many tiles I played each game to get an average point-per-tile. However, the use of Meeples (followers) should be included as well.

One big thing in Carcassonne is profiting on the other players moves. So the 2.8 to 4.3 points are per own tile you place.
Later you mention getting the others to build on your cloister, road city etc.
But I feel this is a very important issue.

Carcassonne is a game of invasion. Best Invader wins.
Unless all players invade other players cities. Then the best Defender wins.



Tema 35: What it all comes down to....
Pregunta:
Okay folks - after playing Carcassonne and its various expansions about a zillion times now, I can say - with confidence - that there are two key strategies that will win you the game every time if you can pull them off.

1) monopolize the fields - at all costs. More often than not this will win you the game, even if you haven't completed a lot of cities.

2) If you cant do #1, complete at least on Cathedral city. It's your only chance AND/OR if you're playing with the King/Robber Baron expansion make sure you are either one or both of them.

Now - does the reduction of the game to these two strategies lessen how much I love the game? No. It's a classic. It's just that my game group and I have played it so much that it's kind of played itself out.

I still think my strategy guide that I wrote holds because there are a lot of very valid strategies you can use to help you win. But more often than not the two above are what gets the most points, particularly the former.

I think I'm ready to retire this one for a while - but I maintain that Carcassonne is one of the best games ever made.

Enjoy

Tema 36: strategy tips?
Pregunta:
My friends and I are becoming addicted to Carcassonne. There are some general strategies that seem to becoming clear, yet I keep losing! Would some one be willing to comment on these general ideas?
1. The tile with two (or more) sections of city on them seem to be prime farmer tiles because of the possibilities of completing cities. (the isolated farm in the middle of four cities in the expansion seems desirable since no one can hord in on it!) True?
2. Cloisters generally demand a monk if you have one. True?
3. City tiles with the herald seem to demand a knight since you get at least two points for it at the end of the game, but hopefully more. True?
4. The river tends to make one big farm, so it's important to get in on it.
5. Road only tiles, in theory are good to close off one's opponent's farm, but how?
6. Defensive strategy includes getting three or four tiles around the spot your opponent wants to play, thus stranding followers. Right?
Thanks for your advice!

Re:strategy tips?
doctortuxedo (#25982),

1. For one, it depends on which scoring method you use. On per-city scoring, the 'courtyard' tile isn't nearly so powerful. On per-field scoring, it's nice, but inherently capped (that field could NEVER border on more than four cities, and maybe that farmer played elsewhere might border on more cities).

2. Generally, unless you know one of its 'points' is already boxed-in and will make it very difficult to retrieve. Or if there's a more pressing need for play on field or road. Or if you only have *one* meeple in lategame and you feel it may be better saved for next turn rather than risk heading into the next turn with no meeples at all.

3. Again, a matter of circumstance. tying up a knight long-term for a few points may not be the wisest move.

4. One big farm happens often with the basic set, and in fact, the river seems to reduce this effect.

5. Uh, by forming a road-barrier or road-loop that will eventually act as a divider between the opponent's farm and some developing cities. Place a field edge of the road next to the opponent's field and then extend the road in later turns (or, as in #6, work towards making the road, and field, impossible to extend).

6. Absolutely. A good understanding of the 'odds' of a matching tile remaining in the tile-pile is helpfiul, too. Leave a very improbable (or even impossible!) combination of edges to match. In the basic game there are a lot of impossible 4-edge combinations. The expansions make a lot of these 'impossibles' into 'not likely but possible' situations.

Respuesta 2:
Re:strategy tips?
thatmarkguy (#26017),

To build on the road-barrier discussion, it is quite easy to fence in a sizeable field with relatively few road pieces.

Remember that since roads must be matched with roads a straight road piece essentially blocks off the place it is played as well as the places to either side.

Consider a field that has an open end six tiles in width. The entire side can be effectively blocked up with two straight road pieces played at the second and fifth tiles. Though it would be possible for the owner of the field to open it up with the right combination of curved road pieces this would cost several actions to accomplish for no guaranteed gain.

Tema 37: Strategy Guide
Pregunta:
A Brief Carcassonne Strategy Guide:

Carcassonne has become somewhat of an epidemic at my house in the past several months. There is a group of three to five of us who play it at several times a week. It seems like Carcassonne is about they only thing the groups wants to play. Although I prefer to change things up a bit, after playing Carcassonne probably close to 100 times I’d say I have gathered a pretty decent handle on the strategy of the game.

Hence, I thought a brief strategy guide is in order to share some of the things I’ve learned. It should be noted that this article covers the following:

Basic Carcassonne
The River Expansion
Inns and Cathedrals &
Traders and Builders

In addition, this guide assumes that the readers have a decent understanding of the rules of play.

Basic Concept: As you all know by now, Carcassonne is a tile laying game where players compete to score the most victory points. Points are scored by completing cities, roads, cloisters, and occupying farms. Expansions spice things up a bit by adding additional scoring options, including cathedrals, inns, commodities and pigs. I strongly recommend playing the basic game first prior to using the expansions.

The Element of Luck: There are some who would say that Carcassonne has too much luck involved. Although I understand that everyone’s taste regarding a game’s luck component varies, I would disagree with the notion that Carcassonne has “too much” luck. “Too much” luck implies that there is either not enough strategy or so much luck involved that it impedes the ability of individual players to truly influence their own outcome. After several sessions the conclusion that I have come to is that a) there is plenty of strategy involved, all-be-it some techniques are quite subtle and take a while to understand and b) the outcome of the game is usually reflective of which players employ good strategy and game play, and which do not.

However, it is the luck element that, for me, keeps the game fresh. Luck plays enough of a role in the game that, from time to time, even a novice can sit down and beat a seasoned player (My brother, for example, whipped me the first time he played the game). The luck element can (but by definition does not always) assist a new player and help make them more competitive. At long last, it is very rare that any one player will win time after time. This makes the game more fun for everyone.

Points Now or Points Later: The fundamental strategy issue presented in Carcassonne (as in so many other games) is how to balance your game play. In this case, the player must determine how to best balance continuing to build victory points “now” by developing cities, roads and cloisters versus ensuring they have enough farmers in the field to gain points during the end game. Rarely will a player who either tries to build “now” points or tries to monopolize field space exclusively win the game. My personal strategy emphasises about two-thirds to three-quarters of my energy on now points and one-third to one quarter of my energy on end-game points. Others in my group would say the exact opposite. However, I prefer the former because it allows you greater flexibility of settlers. That is to say, placing a farmer in a field removes that settler for the rest of the game. Securing “now” points allows you to keep your pool of settlers more plentiful. More settlers means more options (see below).

Other players in my group have had considerable success with the alternative strategy. It’s really just a matter of playing style, how you are more comfortable seeing the flow of the game, and how much risk you are willing to take. At the end of the day, each strategy is probably equally successful but each requires different game play techniques. It’s also important to note that comitting 100% of your resources to “now” points OR end-game points usually results in a loss.

Managing your Men: One of the most important rules to remember in Carcassonne is that settlers are life. The more settlers you have in your pool, the more options you have available to you. On the flip side, the more settlers you have available to you, the fewer you have in play. Fewer settlers in play means that you have a decreased capacity to score points. Hence, “managing your men” is one of the fundamental strategies in Carcassonne. If you fail here, you’ve had it.

If you have no settlers in your pool, you can not start any new scoring opportunities until others have been completed, and those settlers returned to your pool. I don’t know how many times I’ve been nickeled and dimed by other players who have settlers left in their pool who can take advantage of making small cities or short roads while I can do nothing because my pool is empty. In this case, have fun watching your lead disappear or your opponent’s lead get larger. But as the old saying goes, ships were meant to sail, so keeping your pool too large means your missing out on points.

By mid-game I normally like to have all but between one and three of my settlers committed. As the game starts to draw to a close, I like to have one or maybe two left over. in any case remember a few things when you’re debating whether to place a settler or not:

Economy of Force: For all you military buffs out there, economy of force is huge in Carcassonne. In other words, only use as many settlers in any given spot as you have to. NEVER over commit settlers - they’re a finite resource that must be managed precisely! If you over allocate them in one area (normally a city) you’re probably losing out somewhere else.
Keep a Reserve: Before placing a settler anywhere (particularly on a field) always consider a few things. a) how many settlers do you have left. Only play the last settler in your pool if you really need to. Otherwise hang onto it. b) consider where your other settlers are on the board. If you have several settlers tied up in fields or on cloisters or cities that are still several turns from being completed (and hence several turns before they are returned to the pool) you might want to rethink playing a settler that would either deplete your reserve or reduce it to only one.
The Double Settler: Be VERY careful with this settler as it is extremely valuable. If it gets tied up for a long period of time OR if it is put in a field and then trapped (see below) you’re at a severe disadvantage. I rarely play this piece early in the game for this reason.

Building Cities: Without a doubt, building cities of the right size and in the right location is critical to winning the game. It’s a fair statement that if you don’t build several cities throughout the game your chances of winning decrease dramatically. In addition, when playing with city tiles that contain commodities, successful completion of cities is essential to victory both in terms of scoring “now” points as well as for collecting points in the end game.



As with everything in the game, there are a few things to keep in mind when you build a city:

Building a Large City Can Hurt You: Knowing when to continue a city’s construction and when to finish it is important. Whereas it is undeniable that completing a large city will bring a significant number of points (i consider a small city to be between 2 and 6 tiles, a medium city to be between 6 and 10 tiles, and a large city to be 11 tiles and up) it also can take a considerable amount of time and require several settlers. The rule of thumb is to complete a city as quickly as possible and with the least number of settlers. The longer it takes to complete a city and the more settlers you commit to it (see “Playing Defense” below) the fewer scoring options you have throughout the board. As a result, don’t be overly tempted to build enormous cities. The bottom line is to not put all your eggs in one basket. Remember - Carcassonne is all about balance and preserving your scoring options.
The Problem with Cathedrals: In many ways I hate having to build a city with a cathedral in it. Granted, the payoff can be huge. But if you’re playing with experience players the first thing your opponents will try to do is make it very difficult to complete the city. You’ll find that as soon as you play a cathedral tile in one of your cities you become a big target for everyone else (and for good reason). As a result, you could wind up spending a lot of resources and time trying to build something that doesn’t get you any points. Normally I will only try to build a cathedral city early in the game or about midway through the game. The later in the game, the harder it will be to complete the city as fewer tiles are available.
Tips for Building: Probably the most important rule when building a city is to keep your options open at all times and avoid building yourself into a situation where only a limited number of tiles will work. To do this, try to build in a direction AWAY from the majority of the board with as many open tile sides (that is to say, sides that are not adjacent to other tiles) as possible. This both gives the building player more options but makes it harder for other players to shanghai the city (see below) for themselves.
Where NOT Build: This is a fairly simple rule of thumb - avoid building cities adjacent to fields controlled by your opponents. All this does is give your opponent(s) points in the end game. If you DO build a city adjacent to one of their fields, make sure to try to get a majority in that field(s) later in the game.

Building Roads: On the surface, roads don’t seem to be that big of a deal in Carcassonne. But looks can be deceiving. Roads are largely a secondary source of “now” points behind cities. Roads serve two functions in the game - a) they serve as a good secondary source of points, and b) they serve to divide fields (which can be valuable as a defense tactic - see below). You can also use roads to make your opponents cities harder to complete (see below).

Bottom line, roads should not be ignored, nor should they be wasted by placing them in locations that don’t enhance your current position. In short - don’t waste road pieces. Pay particular attention to road segments that have an “inn on the lake”. These tiles can actually be used as a primary source of points (in addition to cities) if used correctly.

Placing Farmers: Farmers, more than any other type of settler, require the most management. The balancing act here is to be able to secure “now” points and allocate the proper number of farmers in the fields to be competitive during the end game. The number of farmers you place, and the timing of their placement will depend on your overall game strategy (see Points Now or Points Later). There are a few rules of thumb to remember when placing farmers regardless of your overall strategy:


Establish Farms Early: It is essential to establish dominance in at least one field early. If this does not occur early in the game it will be increasingly difficult to do as the game progresses.
Create Large Farms: Avoid placing farmer in small, confined areas surrounded by roads. Farmers are most affective when they occupy large fields that are adjacent to as many cities as possible. Be aware that other players will be looking to play pieces that will eventually link, and therefore challenge the dominance of existing farmers. In addition, look to link your own farmers with existing fields occupied by your opponents. Remember that you don’t have to have dominance to get points in the end game - you only need to have at least as many as you opponents.
Link Farms to Opponents Farms: Always seek to place farmers in such a way that will allow them to be linked to the farms of an opponent in later turns. Tiles such as cloisters (particularly those without roads) or “elbow” road pieces are perfect for linking fields.
Placing Farmers after Completing a City: Remember after a you have completed a city not to get carried away in the excitement of scoring points (I know this sounds basic, but I see it happen all the time). Take your time and look to see if placing a farmer in the field outside your city on the tile you just placed makes sense. It might!
Use the Double Settler: In most cases the double settler, I’ve found, is far more affective when placed in a field than when placed in a city (see How to shanghai a City below). It’s tempting to place this piece early and sometimes that makes sense. However, holding the double settler in reserve until the game has unfolded slightly normally results in a more efficient use of the piece - you don’t want to waste this one by playing it to early and having it get trapped.
Settlers and the River: If you’re playing with the River expansion keep in mind that of the original 12 tiles (10 tiles, a spring tile and a lake tile) keep in mind that two of the tiles have roads that bisect them completely and one of them (the cloister) has a road that runs half way across the tile. Avoid placing your farmers during the River phase directly between any two of these three. This will almost always lead to your farmer getting trapped by one of your opponents.
Use the Pig: Be sure to find a way to use the pig (Traders and Builders expansion). This is one of the best ways to get a few extra points at the end of the game. Carcassonne is often decided by just a few victory points - the pig is a way to squeeze all the points you can out of the game. However, resist using the pig early in favor of waiting to see how the fields shape up over the course of the game. Place the pig in the field where you are adjacent to the most cities. Like the double settler, the pig is not a piece that should be wasted.

Cloisters: Other than getting points, cloisters really only serve one other purpose and that is to help link fields together. However, cloisters can be very helpful during the endgame (see below). As a general rule, when placing a cloister always seek to locate the tile in an area that maximizes both the number of tiles that are adjacent to it at the time of placement, and that is in a position where completing the cloister is probable. As a tip, many times the best place to put a cloister is next to another one of your own cloisters.

Commodities: Commodities (Traders and Builders expansion) completely change the face of the game. Here are a few tips on how to take advantage of commodities:

Seek to Acquire Cloth and Wheat over Barrels: There are fewer cloth and wheat markers than barrel markers. As a result, it takes less time to corner the market on these commodities (specifically cloth of which there are only 5 markers) than barrels.



Take Advantage of the “Closing” Rule: Remember that whoever completes a city with commodities gets the commodities - even if the closing player doesn’t control it! There may be cases when an opponent only needs one tile to close a city; in essence it’s simply a matter of time. A good strategy, in these cases, is to close the city for them. Even though the opponent gets the points, you deprive them of the commodities. This strategy is fairly aggressive, but it works. On the flip side, be careful not to set yourself up to have on of your cities closed by another player for this very reason.
If There is a Choice, Add Sections with Commodities to Cities: in many cases a single tile will contain several city sections. Some will have commodities, and others won’t. When given the choice (and when doing so won’t make closing the city more difficult in the future) add to your city with the side of the tile that contains a city section with a commodity.

Using the Builder: The builder (Traders and Builders expansion) may be the most useful piece in the game. It is the only mechanism in the game that will allow a player to select a second tile. This presents an incredible advantage when played properly. Strategies to use when playing the builder include:

General Use: When you control a city by placing a settler on it, the next tile that is played to expand the city should have the builder placed on it. Priority should be given to cities with cathedrals. Trying to complete a city with a cathedral without the assistance of the builder is much more difficult.
Cities or Roads: Because cities are the primary scoring mechanism of “now” points and because they are generally more difficult to complete than roads, the builder should be used more for cities than for roads. This is not to say, however, that it should never be used for roads - in fact many often forget entirely that the builder is availible for use on both.

Playing Defense: Once again balance is the key to the overall strategy of the game. In this case, an all offensive strategy based entirely on scoring as many points as possible while ignoring the actions of the other opponents may work against inexperienced players, but will surely backfire against more seasoned players. On the flip-side, playing all defense will not work either. To win, players must aggressively pursue scoring opportunities as well as create and develop situations that will prevent your opponents from doing the same. The following are a few techniques to do just that:

Making Cities Unbuildable / Trapping the Builder: Whenever possible, use tiles to make it more difficult for an opponent to complete a city. This is done by placing tiles that force your opponent to draw tiles of a particular configuration to either continue building or to complete the city. Pay special attention to cities where your opponent has placed their builder. The longer it takes for your opponent to complete a city with a builder on it, the less your opponent will be able to use their builder to develop other scoring opportunities across the board.
Trapping Farmers: Use roads or cities to form barriers around your opponents fields. This will keep your opponents fields from being adjacent to several cities. If done properly (and quickly) a farmer can be completely surrounded without being adjacent to any cities, removing its ability to score any points.
How to shanghai a City: This is an essential tactic to employ against an opponent building a city with a cathedral. Place a tile near, but not connected to, the city your opponent is building. Place one of your settlers on the tile in the city segment - preferably the double settler if it is available. The tile should be placed in such a way that the next city tile you draw (of the appropriate configuration) will connect that piece to the city and hence either give you control of the city or an equal share of the city.
Making Roads and Cloisters Harder to Build: Along the same lines as making cities unbuildable, try to place tiles that will require opponents to play a tile with a specific configuration to add to or complete the cloister. The more your opponent’s options are limited, the harder it will be for them to score.
Making “Suggestions”: The rules of the game clearly provide that players can make “suggestions” to their opponents about the best place to lay their tiles. Spare no expense to lie to your opponents as much as you want when it comes to this. But be sure to do it with some shred of credibility - otherwise no one will listen to you!
Working Together: It’s not out of the question for two or more players to work together against one or more other players. Although I don’t really recommend this tactic as it takes some of the fun out of the game, for all you cutthroats out there, don’t hesitate to double up on defensive moves against a common opponent. This can be a MUST when one of your opponents is trying to build a city with a cathedral.
Using Conflicts to Your Advantage: In many cases two or more players will spend a lot of time and resources trying to out score one another. Generally this will happen when two or more players compete for control of a large city. While these other players are busy slugging it out, they most likely won’t be paying attention to anything else. Take advantage of this time to score as many points as you can with little worry of defensive maneuvers against you.
Inns and Cathedrals: It’s important to remember that unfinished cities with a cathedral and roads with an inn are not scored at the end of the game. Use these tiles toward the end of the game (if available) on existing cities or roads your opponents occupy if you think they won’t be able to complete them by the end of the game.

The Odds: In many situations players have to try to figure out whether a certain tile remains in the pool in order to complete a city or a road or a cloister. In this was knowledge of which pieces exist and in what quantity will help determine whether a tile still remains or not. As a simple example, there are two cathedral tiles. So once the second cathedral is played, no more are available. Like counting cards, try to remember how many of each type of tile there are in the pool and then make a mental note when they get played. Keep a running tabulation in your head as the game progresses. This is a daunting task as there are well over 100 tiles in the game.

A great reference exists on boardgamegeek.com that details each type of tile and their quantity. However, the following are some general themes to keep in mind:

There are 130 tiles (by my count) included in the basic game and the expansions considered by this guide, 12 of which are “river” tiles played at the beginning of the game.
Of the 12 river tiles, there are 2 with roads that bisect the tile completely, one cloister tile with a road that bisects the tile half way, seven river tiles (some with city segments), a spring tile and a lake tile.
Of the 118 tiles remaining:
41 have BOTH a city segment and a road segment
35 have city segments ONLY
27 have road segments ONLY
4 have cloisters with roads
4 have cloisters with no roads
and 2 have cathedrals

Hence, in the beginning of the game you are more likely to draw a tile with a city segment either with or without a road than you are to draw a tile with only a road on it. As a result, have your builder ready to go early. If you start drawing a lot of roads early, take heart - you’ll most likely start turning up city tiles in the very near future, so don’t be alarmed if everyone else is building cities like mad. As the game progresses, make a note of which tiles have been drawn and which are still in the bag. Utilizing this tactic will help you decide on which defensive moves will be most affective and how much risk you can afford to take when building your cities.

The End Game: The end game may be the most important phase of the game. As the tile bag empties you should take the following steps to ensure scoring the most points possible - and remember every point counts!

Play Your Pig: If your pig isn’t in play, get it in play. It’s as simple as that. Find a way to play it and fast. Place your pig in a place adjacent to as many cities as possible.
Place Available Settlers on Incomplete Roads and Cities: If you have available settlers, play them on incomplete cities and roads to take advantage of as many points as you can.
Place Last Minute Farmers: If you have the opportunity to place last minute farmers, do it. Remember that each farm you control will gain you four points for each city it’s adjacent to.
Add to Your Cloisters: Many times at the end of the game you’ll draw pieces that don’t seem to have much value. On the contrary, many times these pieces can be used creatively to add to cloisters. Even if the piece will make it almost impossible to complete the cloister, when it’s close to the end of the game play it anyway.

Are You A Master Yet? Hardly. The beauty of Carcassonne is it’s simplicity to learn but near impossibility to master. However, these few tips will most likely increase your score and enhance your shot at victory. Good luck and have fun.

Re:Strategy Guide
Excellent article, David! Well articulated, and your strategies are sound advice for competitive play. Although it somewhat has the reputation of a very lightweight game, Carcassonne truly is a game that can be approached as a thinking person's game. Part of the beauty of Carcassonne is that it works as a lighthearted social game or as a more cutthroat gamer's game.

I do have a couple of small points to add.

Sharing the Load
If someone horns in on "your" city, don't panic. It can often be more profitable to share the city than to compete for sole control. With two of you working together, you'll have twice as many chances to draw the tiles you need to complete the city. Also, you avoid wasting resources in a zero-sum arms race. Although I play mostly two- and three-player games, this advice is particularly fitting in games with four or more players.

Know the Tile Mix
You touched on this somewhat in your article, in terms of knowing what tiles are remaining to be drawn. But knowing the tile mix also aids your efforts to block other players' efforts by crowding the unbuilt areas of their cities, cloisters, and farms. For example, if you are playing with just the original, unexpanded game, there are no tiles with one road edge and one or two city edges. All of the one-road-edge tiles have either three city edges or three field edges. Knowing this, it is possible to cruelly set up unbuildable spaces on the board, in areas that stymie your opponents. The expansions broaden the tile mix, but it still helps to know what sort of tiles are very rare in the overall mix.

Re:Strategy Guide
Thank you! Carcassonne is big in my group. We play it all the time.

And i agree with your comments - sometimes working together to complete a city is better than fighting over it...particularly if you and the other player who are building the City are behind another player who is in the lead. It can help you get back in the game.

I also agree that far too many people see Carcassonne as a "non-thinkers" game. Granted there is a lot of luck, part of the charm is figuring out how to best utilize the unpredictable nature of the luck element - in essence how to best lay the tiles you randomly draw. That means you never get the same game twice.

I look forward to hearing more comments and strategies from you!

Enjoy!

davidgpeterson (#23534),

Great tips. After I review this I will see if I have anything to add. I play a lot vs. the computer (Koch Media software) and I think I employ different strategies against the computer than I would vs. human opponents.

Off the top of my head (sorry if I'm repeating your good advice - I'll clean this up later):

Inns:
Always try to have one meeple on a road section. Then if you happen to draw an Inn tile you can join it to your road, and not have to waste other things on the tile, like a city or farm segment. After mid to late game, make sure any Inn roads you have are not open at both ends. You are risking too much if you think you can close both ends of a road late in a game. Don't touch an Inn tile near the end of the game, but do try to add it to another player's open road to strand a meeple.

Builders:
I find they work better in cities than on roads. It seems more likely to me that you can draw tiles with city sections. Many times other players are helping to add to you city, so having the Builder can help you regain control of a good city by giving you extra moves. You should almost always have your Builder on the table. If not, you are losing the big benefit of drawing extra tiles. Do be careful your Builder can't get stranded early in the game.

Pig:
Try to play the Pig relatively early, at least at a point where you figure it will get you safely a minimum of 4-5 extra points at the end of the game. If you fail to get your pig out or in to a good field, you could end up losing in a close game.

Special Farmer Tile:
There is a unique tile where a small field is surrounded by four small city segments (call them caps). Often players put a farmer there, a good move if there is time enough in the game left to complete the surrounding cities. Also a good move, if there are not too many road segments encroaching near the uncompleted cities. Could be worth as much or more as a cloister if all the cities get finished, and depending on which scoring method you use for farmers.

Goods:
Generally try to make sure you are first in at least one of the goods; after that don't worry about them too much. As long as you can get at least 10 points from this, no one is likely to pull away from you here.

Cathedrals:
Can be deadly at the end of the game, stranding meeples for no points. There are only two tiles in the bag, so always be aware if there are any left. Early in the game, try to add a builder and finish the city quickly before others make it hard to complete. Late in the game try to join Cathedrals with multiple cities to strand as many opponent's meeples as possible.

Sharing Points:
Not such a bad thing if that other player is not close to you in points. In fact, let them finish off the city/road for you if there is no way they can steal control. You can then concentrate on other things.

Super Meeple:
Usually best for winning control of cities. Sometimes it should be played on a very valuable field, but never on a road.

Points:
I would be interested to see some statistics as to what is a good score (depending on the number of players and expansions used). It would be good to know what is a good average for points per turn or points per meeple. In four plyer gmaes on the computer using all expansion (except the River) you need at least 100 points to win; 150 points will usually give you victory.

Excellent strategy article about my favorite game!

I have found in 2, 3, and 5 player games the builder is of utmost importance whether played in the city or on the roads. It gives you tile control. If you can play twice as many tiles as your opponents without builders then you have greater control over how the board will be laid out. I have used the builder on the most open terrain, whether a road with an inn by the lake or on a city. It depends on which terrain I'll have the fewest problems completing based on surrounding tiles (or lack of surrounding tiles - a good thing).

Another strategy I have found useful, especially in 2 or 3 player games, is playing all your settlers close together. Keeping settlers clustered increases the chances of adding on to two features with only one tile. It could also make your farmers more valuable as you try to control the size and amount of cities in your little neck of Car-burbia. If I can't add on to my own cities/roads/cloisters then I use the tile to wreck my opponents' features.

Great article. A few comments:

1) The random element is like Mahjong... you must adapt to your luck or lack of luck. Remember there are three basic choices (positive, negative, neutral): 1-Develop your projects. 2-Clearly, when you get a tile that can't advance your own projects, you must actively look to derail another player's. 3-If you can't build or derail, make sure you don't inadvertently create an opportunity for another.

2) More on luck... just like poker, your play MUST vary with the number of players. For example, in a two-player game you can control your destiny to a far greater extent than when there are more. Take larger risks with fewer players, less risk with more players.

3) We recently acquired The Tower. There are several interesting elements to it, especially the little tower pieces. I would recommend reducing the number given out, otherwise the game become too topsy-turvey.

4) A neutralizing strategy is to play like a parasite. For example, if you place your cloister next to another player's cloister when he has fewer followers in his pool. He has a greater incentive to finish the cloister than you have. For each tile he places around it, most likely, the points are neutralized by your placement of a cloister adjacent. There are a variety of parasite strategies: getting a farmer into a field where your opponent is building cities, threatening a close city by using your double-follower can often induce the other player to add to your city in an attempt to block the attack, etc.

5) Tile distribution is key. It is worth examining your entire set and making a detailed distribution card to give to all. Being in a situation where only a few tiles will finish a city should frighten you from placing a follower.

6) Time of play... ok... There is a reason why chess players use clocks... I wish the same were standard in most games. When a guest takes 3 to 10 times the amount of time to consider the absolute perfect location to place his tile, you better slow down or agree at the beginning on a standard. I love to play several games... something that is impossible if the suggested 30-45 minute game time balloons to 60-90 minutes (something that has happened). If your guest doesn't get it, by all means play as slow.

7) When there are few tiles left, make certain you scope out all of the possibilities for small farms. Getting 4 or 8 points is a heck of lot better than trying to build cities, roads and cloisters in the last few tiles.

8) If you finish the game with 1 or more free followers, you are probably not playing well. Try, without being stuck early in the game, to have all down by the last tile.

9) Though alluded to earlier, try to sabotage your opponent's use of the engineer. That includes finishing his project for the sake of his/her having to start over again or much better, stranding him where there is no tile to finish. I have won more games on the ability to strand my opponent's engineer while I was getting extra turns using mine. This is probably the single most powerful tool to winning.

10) Be careful being tempted to get an extra turn with your engineer if it forces you to play a tile that makes further development/completion very difficult.

11) When building roads, there is nothing wrong with long roads, but try to build outwards where there will be no adjacent tiles for another player to try to link into. Also, if your opponent is building a road with a scenic tile on it (double points), it may be worth your while to close his road to limit the potential damage.

12) If you have lost control of a city with your engineer on it, by all means close it as quickly as possible... yes, you are giving points to your opponent, but leaving the engineer is a sure way to lose extra turns and thus points in general.

I dunno if you guys play on ipad but "luck" is a stretch of a word to use, the order of the cards changes as the game moves along to keep everyone smiling. If no one makes a mistake and the cards are always used in an optimal spot the game will always finish even or damn close.

Also if you are first in the field the cards will be kinder to you and shoot block cards to get rid of the enemy farmers.

Its easy to notice 1v1 vanilla.

Have fun
